    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

You Could join ANA mileage club and use their award tool to search for *A award tickets
But is there a schedule of when the conversions will actually begin and the rate of conversions?
SFO -- FRA on UA900/901 is always a 744; this summer, there will be another covering one of the ORD -- FRA turns.
You would think so, but it just doesn't work that way. I had two VDBs recently and in both cases the GA initially refused to give TCs. One stated that they were only given for international flights, and the other stated that they were simply not offering those for the particular flight in question.  After a bit of pushback from me along with my usual statement of "I received travel credits by VDB-ing off of a domestic flight recently" the GAs both stated that they would check with a supervisor. A while later supervisors arrived and in both cases granted the TCs. As a side note, one of these situations was at DEN which IME is notoriously difficult to get TCs from.
Wirelessly posted (SonyEricssonZ750a/R1DB Browser/NetFront/3.4 Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 UP.Link/6.3.1.20.06.3.1.20.0)  I totally get why UA prefers to give out DBCs for VDBs, but frankly it's really annoying to get into it with recalcitrant GAs who won't give TCs when pressed. I've never failed to get them, but it has involved some unpleasant situations.
for that reason do you think if we booked an f ticket for say august the 777 would be the new retrofit? or is it impossible to say. we'd be going lax to lhr.  thanks everyone.
It'd only be really spooky if the 13th was a Friday and you'd only planned to fly that day   Was asked this routinely, more recently - by the Asian call centers' real agents - also when I have several itins booked and they just pick a random one . Most noteworthy I was asked if I was calling about my return from YVR when I had not even yet departed for YVR.
Wirelessly posted (BlackBerry8900/5.0.0.411 Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/100)  I'd be surprised if more than 5 were converted by August, so the chances of getting one will be slim
it seems to always just be the soonest trip you have booked, regardless of how many you have.
if we have a destination in europe what airport will get us the United 747? we usually fly into LHR and then connect on local flight to our europe destination. anywhere you go its only 1 to 2 hours.
Select markets would include DOMESTIC markets in most cases, in contrast the entire system, which is Intl as well as domestic.
agreed. you should call as you never know what will happen if you get a good agent (and remember f/t 101: if you don't like what you hear, call back)
Checked in 24 hours before flight. When I got to the ticket counter was told it was almost definitely not going to happen. Inquired inside at the counter and they said where were 8 GS on the list on front of 1Ks and 20+ 1Ks on the plane as well.  Sat 23 Jan, same flight, also 1K on M. Flight connections counter woman said, "wow, I've never seen so many 1K's on a flight," but I find that hard to believe. In any event, she said there were more than 10 ahead of me, and in the end I think only 2 got UG.  January has to be pretty tough, with everyone trying to use up any previous-year SWU before they expire, everyone having their new set available, plus the highest number of 1K's of the year with the overlap of expiring and new ones.  This is I think my fifth or sixth failure in just 3 full years as a 1K -- once on an outbound SFO to Europe (can't remember exactly which flight), once on PVG-SFO trying for C -&gt; NF, and the rest on 901 trying for B/M/H -&gt; NC.
As a 1P and a 1K, any time I've called in the last 6 months or so, the live agent asked me if I was calling about trip xxx (always my most-immediate upcoming itin, IIRC). HAL hasn't asked if I was calling about trip xxx that I can recall, but I've also always had more than one booked the past few times I've called.
Called 1K desk to change my flight on Friday &amp; they said no-go flight is oversold. Went to my computer and confirmed change went through no problem even though H=0.
Unless they treat PS differently, you should be able to clear domestic F on an international "XC"(award biz booking code) award. I recently did a roundtrip PHX-IAD-FCO XC ticket, and both ways I was in F PHX-IAD/IAD-PHX, and in C IAD-FCO.  Is it possible the Int'l leg cleared and you are waitlisted XF on the domestic legs?  Unless I am mistaken, Int'l XC award = Dom XF seating enroute- I'd stay on it/call 1K or whatever. Should work out.
Nope, tried to do that a couple weeks ago.  I wanted to add the wife but they wouldn't do that (well, they would do it, but charge me the full difference for the few months remaining). I asked if I could cancel the current one, get the couple of months of miles refunded, and then just renew from today.  Nope, sorry.  The people on the RCC service line answered on the second ring and were very nice, so you can try, but I wouldn't expect it to happen.
I was able to put a flight on hold from BOS to HKG via ORD returning via Narita on ANA/UA combination.  Thanks for the help.
economy is fine
You can also use the UA website to check loads on the IAD/ORD-FRA flights.  My reccomendation is to stay on UA metal and fly from IAD to FRA on the early evening 777. LH is a much better product but you never know how the loads will be in C on a given night.  Benny thanks. Sounds like the smart move.

the following shows up available for your dates:  4/1 EWR-YYZ-HKG (AC/AC) Air Canada flight 763 operated by Air Canada. Air Canada flight 15 operated by Air Canada.  4/13 HKG-YYZ-EWR (AC/AC) Air Canada flight 16 operated by Air Canada. Air Canada flight 772 operated by Air Canada.  (Y-class)  but don't know if UA will let you bookgood luck
These brochures have been around in Denver for a couple of years. And DEN is as hard as anywhere (IME) to get TC's
Wirelessly posted (BlackBerry8320/4.5.0.81 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/100)  This statement is also right on the slip of paper that gets printed out when you get on the VDB list - the one that says "Our United Commitment" on the top. I'm not sure if a GA would be swayed by it or not.
Can someone more versed in award redemptions help me book a flight from JFK, LGA or BOS to HKG on United or another *Alliance member?  Optimal would be leaving from US on April 1st and returning on April 12-14th Alternative would be to leave March 29/30th and return April 7th-9th.  I checked and there's no award availability from United.com for saver awards.
Would be nice to have in hand. Even better to scan and keep on my laptop as I'm sure I'd lose it.
Fri, Jan 22, 2010, UA 955 LHR -&gt; SFO - 1K on M ticket.  Checked in 24 hours before flight. When I got to the ticket counter was told it was almost definitely not going to happen. Inquired inside at the counter and they said where were 8 GS on the list on front of 1Ks and 20+ 1Ks on the plane as well.  First time I've had a trans-atlantic upgrade fail in a long time, even last year when I was 1P using miles I'd get cleared on check in. Was especially bad this time because I wasn't even in E+ (38B). I'd forgotten how much standard economy SUCKS when the guy in front of you reclines on a long flight.
Would you take the risk?  Nope would never "take the risk" of asking my wife to drive me to airport at 4 AM
Are you wanting a Y C or F award?  How many connections are you willing to make?  You could look into fly ANA to NRT then connecting onto HKGThat is probably what I would do.   Sign up for the ANA mileage tool and you'll be able to check award space (then you'll have to get around *net blocking with UA).
The full schedule is not public to my knowledge, but the first plane will go in for refit (and a C check) on 10 Feb last I read.
and the other stated that they were simply not offering those for the particular flight in question.  As we all know, the first statement is certainly not true.  As far as the second statement, in addition having to challenge the select market concept to get TCs, we now also have to challenge select flights?
SWU upgrade successes 2010 onward
Was out at COS yesterday and saw that UA has set up a sort of info/sign-up kiosk in front of the check-in counters. One of the brochures, which discussed VDBs, contained this statement: Â?If we need your seat, we will transport you on the next available flight to your destination and provide you with a travel credit or, in select markets, a free ticket.Â?  Very interesting. Per this statement, it would certainly appear that the primary compensation for a VDB, in the majority of UA markets, would be a travel creditwould it not?  In retrospect I should have picked up a copy of this brochure. Will do so next trip to the airport. Can then show any GA that claims that UA no longer offers travel credits, in black and white, that it does. Now to get UA to specifically identify those elusive Â?select marketsÂ?.
Since non-UA MP award flights have to be done with an agent, you might just as well call and ask for options. You don't need to take the first offer.
This has been around for some time. I just wish it recognized my numberfor some reason most of the time it does not.
Absolutely not.  When UA decided to close a few RCC (ATL, MSP, DFW) several years ago, so I had called up RCC, and write to CS about the issue. So I asked for 10% of my miles back, about 5000 miles, as they had closed 10% of RCC, it should be fair, still no dice.  For you to cancel without any reasonable reason like I had, it is defiantely no chance to happen at all.
Cool
I've called up the 1K line before and they've had the last search I made on .bomb on their screen. It wasn't even ticketed or purchased, just a search. I always thought that was a nice touch.
Thanks, everybody. Today's ORD-MSP is not posted (not a surprise) but Thursday's PDX-ORD is still missing in action. Tomorrow is MSP-DEN-PDX and we'll see what's what on Monday
Continuing the praise, I am currently on my first ever PS flight in United Business. This is most definitely one of the best flights I have had the pleasure of taking within the continental US - and this is a red-eye!  Although the meal options are lacking, the service is outstanding.  All in all, PS is a fantastic product.
It is standard if you only have one trip in your itineraries. Not sure if it is standard if you have more than one.
Often, I find some "1K" agents just don't know or are plain lazy. To get them started, ask to speak to their supervisor. Quick hold, and "yes we will be able to do that for you today" . Supervisor trick works most of the time!
That's a great idea! And who knows, maybe that's the sort of thing we could use to get UA to think about taking care of us tell them that we've got a UA Frequent Flyer cycling event that's heavy on high elites, many of whom are considering other ways to get there (not UA) because of the fees.  Last year I got about 7000 miles on my bike, none of them racing. There's this part of me that would love to get back out there and mix it up in the pack, especially if there were no nasty climbs. Ironic because I love climbing mountains just can't do it like I used to. Those who can't climb (anymore) sprint.  Drobbva- you've been added to the list!  Also send a PM and email to the OP in this thread, asking if he could reference the master list post we're putting together here. Guess I should also make mention of this in the CO forum. The more people who get involved with the various airlines, the better. In fact, it would even be helpful if those members of programs that are favorable to bicycles write thank you notes to their airlines as well!  Crazy idea for a DO- Anybody else heading to France for the 'Tour?
Mike,  Great idea--I'm in. We might also catalog UA lost revenue. You can start with Modern 49er, IAD-CPH on SK in C, which allows a FREE checked bike.  Thanks for doing this.
This is what I've got in this thread, so far. I've included the elite status level, where available (if you're listed as "unknown" and don't mind listing your status, please let me know). As you can see, there's a high percentage of upper-level flyers engaging this thread. If you fly on UA and have issues with the current bike fees, please add a post in this thread so I can add you to this list. The plan is to come up with a simple email that you could cut-and-paste and sent to 1K voice or other appropriate address. My feeling is that, if they get the same email from a number of MP elites in a short period of time, they might pay attention to it. Might. It's worth a shot. Thanks!  And thanks to everyone below for participating in this thread. Oh, dumb question time. Is there an easy way to send a PM to everyone on a list like this?

That time ended for all flights booked after Nov 26th, 2008 if I recall correctly. United had for some time been charging significant amounts for domestic travel, but internationally, United was going with the standard practice on other international carriers no charge for overseas flights. But unlike fares, which get very competitive, fees for carrying bicycles are now all over the map, with a few (including AC) as low as $50, and some up to and over $300 each direction. Rumor has it that Qantas is still hauling bikes across the Pacific for free (as one piece of baggage).
I've had it happen before, and I never use credit card at check-in; either MP card or punch in my MP # on the screen. Even stranger was that the itins brought up were for people with names not even remotely like mine.   At ATL back in 9/09, I went to a Mr. Chicken and swiped my card; Mr. Chicken showed me someone else's itin. So I cancelled and entered my MP # instead. Same itin showed up.  I went to the counter and explained, and the agent was incredulous that Mr. Chicken was calling up someone else's itin. He was able to check me in without a problem, though.
2x Mar 10 IAD-MUC, 2x Mar 16 MUC-IAD, cleared at booking (W fare of course). Midweek, off-season didn't expect a problem and both flights were at least NC5 when booked.  Saved my last two SWUs for a SIN run if/when there's a DEQM promo.
1/27 ICN-SFO 2/3 SFO-ICN  sponsored my GM friend, SFO-ICN cleared at booking and ICN-SFO took two weeks or so. Easy sponsoring route though
I am in. Bring it ON
Two Systemwide Upgrades and a Premier ExecutiveÂ® nomination will be awarded to the member who earns the highest number of Elite Qualifying Miles (EQM) flown on United or United Express each month.        50,000 redeemable miles and a 1KÂ® nomination will be awarded to the first 50 members to reach 250,000 EQM or 250 Elite Qualifying Segments (EQS) in 2010.  The two competitions are not that attractive after you consider the following:  1. ua1flyer will win the first competition each month. There is no chance for anyone to catch ua1flyer's monthly flying activities on UA unless there is someone out there who is not on Flyertalk and is flying more than ua1flyer.  2. The competition is not as competitive and exciting as the "Elite Team Competition".  3. It will be a nightmare for anyone to start a thread keep tracking the status. Potentially any members of Flyertalk.com can enter the competitions. Also, it is easier to track teams as there were less teams. However, FT is only a sample not an population, and there are many roadwarriors out there we don't know about.  4. If we do start a tracking thread, I doubt the ranking would be a reflection of the acutual results. Team competition was a little different, because it was tough to get four people together in the first place and all four had to maintain certain level of flying for 12 months. Both the sample and population were smaller.
..  well I`m out
As of Jan 24th , I have 81,469 EQM . 1K before Valentine's ??
The more legs the more chances it'll get lost. That's just how it is. If you have to change terminals or change airlines or even have a tight connection it just increases the chance it'll get lost.
Got my wife and myself cleared on my SWU's for our trip across the pond in April - in the new business class seats. This is especially helpful since I am 6'5", and am headed over to run the London Marathon in April.  Those will be nice on the way there. But absolutely delightful on the way back. Streeeeeetch those sore legs!  Good on'ya for the upgrades, but at 6'5" I am not sure how much stretching of the legs you can do in the new lie-flat configuration. I'd welcome a report after you return. I personally have felt rather cramped on leg extension when the lie-flat mode is functioning.  Flyer 420 in Seattle
I get this all the time - I don't think I've ever not had multiple names listed when checking in at a hub, and sometimes even at smaller airports.  I've got a fairly common surname, a very common first name, and generally just swipe a credit card (normally not the card the tickets were purchased with).  It's never occurred to me before, but I suppose it's a fairly easy way to get past security when not flying - just hope that the person who's name you pick isn't on the no-fly list
I am in the minority, but find the old UA seat (Lay-Z-Boy) more comfortable than the new UA seat (sarcophagus). Both are better than the LH slant seat (ironing board).  New UA entertainment has more offerings than LH, although the LH is usually more interesting. I've become a big fan of two ensembles I have heard for the first time on LH. And where else do you get to see reruns of Kojak?  The LH food can be excellent, although it's a bit more adventurous than UA's fare. Think of what the UA menus would be with 3 Charlie Trotter offerings, and you pretty much have it.  Service is a matter of taste. I find UA staff tend to be friendlier, and LH staff tend to be more efficient. Although my last LH flight was kind of exceptional - one of the FA's used to work for UA, and remembered me from her UA days.
LHR-IAD UA 925 Dec 07 (W)  All cleared at time of booking on Jan 10.  Wow you are on top of things. You hit the 330 day window and boom! Good job.  These "direct" flights have married segments bunched together. ALL segments on this direct flight have to clear in order for the SWU to clear. Most people, when they learn of these, vow never again. It also will take away from your mileage total as it doesn't break down mileage point to point but directly to your destination as a nonstop.
Does United's standby policy allow you to standby within 24 hours of your flight (similar to Continental's?) or is it just the same calendar day? I have a flight out on 6am, and would love to get out the night before, if possible, but wasnt sure what my full options are.  To be 100% accurate, COs standby policy is not within 24 hours. Per the fare rules on CO non-refundable fares, it is same day of travel with a sliding fee scale based on status from $0 to $50, which may be processed any time up to 24 hours BEFORE the flight (i.e. the checkin window.)  They also allow you to change (not standby, but change) your reservation within 24 hours for the same booking class for the same sliding fee scale, but again, the same booking class must be available and it is confirmed, not standby.   UA's standby is same day (which is industry standard) and free, which is not standard across the industry as differing airlines that do allow standby have different prices.
IAD-LHR Feb 1 W class cleared at booking LHR-ORD-IAH Apr 22 W class cleared at booking IAH-IAD-LHR May 3 W class cleared at booking but they subsequently changed the IAD-LHR plane from a 767 to 777 (old business seats) so I paid to re-route via ORD IAH-ORD-LHR May 3 W class cleared ORD-LHR leg at time of booking
As many have mentioned the priority tag does just short of nothing domestically. Its like writing FRAGILE on a package then giving it to the USPS, it means squat, but if it gets there unharmed some will falsely attribute it to the FRAGILE. I've had delayed bags probably about 5 or 6 times over the last 6 years as a 1K, while its a bummer I do have to say the 1K bag desk is always awesome about calling to update and even calling after the bad is dropped off to make sure I got it.
1/9 LAX-SEA party of 4, first segment of LAX-SEA-NRT-BKK. 2 1Ks upgraded using SWU's ~ 7+ days out; 2 GMs on different PNRs, though "linked" to 1K PNRs not upgraded that segment, but on all others, internationally.
NC0 all day yesterday (including phone call to verify), back to NC 9 this morning !!  My guess is that it was a computer glitch at IM. Hope your wife enjoys C.
If it's a single flight number booked as a through-flight, you're SOL. If not, just call.
Take IAD-PEK-IAD. C is fairly empty.  UA will restart its non-stop IAD-PEK-IAD services this spring, and typically the flights are quiet empty when the route gets restarted.  I have never failed upgrade on this route.  I flew my family of four during the peak of summer travel period in July 2009 (IAD-PEK), and all four of us got upraded to a C cabin with only 6 other passengers on board. There were less than 40 people in Y.
It is not how you start, but it is all about how you finish!  At the end of the day, it only matters when one makes 1K by 12/31 no matter how many miles one flies pass 100K.
Mike - Add me in. In fact over 5 years ago, the USA Cycling/United partnership is what led me to shift all of my flying to United. With a gold membership and 10 vouchers a year it was a no brainer. Without the availability of those vouchers I would take occasional trips when the fee was like $75 or $85, now going with the bike on United doesn't even cross my mind.
In 2009 I had my best year yet. I flew about 7000 miles and road/raced about 8000 on my bike. It was a great year. I never want to be a 1P again and can only dream of being a P1. &lt;grin&gt; Someday we should lead a century followed by a DO.
Hi There,  I am in PIT and thinking about going to PEK. My choice is either to go through ORD or IAD. I am not interested in flying through SFO. Any thoughts on likelihood of the upgrade clearing from Y to C. I called UA and they said the SWU's would go on Waitlist for both routes. But they did not give any hints on load.  I am looking at outbound on April 3 and return on April 13. Does anyone have any history on which route may clear easily? I am not a pro on these segments.  Thanks in advance.
Don't we pretty much know who the winner is already?
Go figure lol. I too subscribe to Pat+ theory that one of the variable in the algorithm may be queries- also agree I can't believe UA IT is up to that. Although, the folks who run the web and the folks who run IM am guessing are NOT the same group
My take also - and since the connection is into C then there should be no baggage fee. Only risk I see is they tag the bag all the way through but then claim due to different PNRs they will charge a domestic baggage fee.
Its that time of the year again 2010 Elite Choice program announced! Register now!    Interesting new choices: --125K EQMs: Nominate a friend to 2P --175K EQMs: Nominate a friend to 1P  For kicks, UA even threw in 2 competitions for the truly hardcore FTers (someone should start a new FT thread to keep track of the front-runners)  For those who love a bit of friendly competition, we have two exciting new reward opportunities that are available only to Mileage PlusÂ® members who register for the 2010 Elite Choice program:         Two Systemwide Upgrades and a Premier ExecutiveÂ® nomination will be awarded to the member who earns the highest number of Elite Qualifying Miles (EQM) flown on United or United Express each month.        50,000 redeemable miles and a 1KÂ® nomination will be awarded to the first 50 members to reach 250,000 EQM or 250 Elite Qualifying Segments (EQS) in 2010.   now I'm extremely curious how much people will value the new 2P, 1P, and 1K nominations
No, there must have been another reason why
update from OP:  NC0 all day yesterday (including phone call to verify), back to NC 9 this morning !!
Old C = 777
Problem with that is that of CO's 40,000 employees, the self-proclaimed "most professional men and women in the industry," only about two (2) of them are aware of this policy.  Yea, I looked up CO's fare rules at work yesterday and wrote down the section word for word to post, but I seem to have lost the paper. I am not aware of how they do it in practice, and your knowledge of application is far superior to mine.  I also (in my post) failed to add a word which might change the meaning significantly, depending on how one reads it. the 2nd line you your reservation (For a flight leaving) within 24 hours (of original flight, not same calendar day) for the same booking class for the same sliding fee scale, but again, the same booking class must be available and it is confirmed, not standby."  I just added the bolded part, as when I read your their practice, but it is the gist of the published fare rule.  As for "most professional men and women in the industry," I too have met a few CO people that have drank a little too much corporate kool-aid and don't know that (published rules) &gt; ("this is how WE at CO do things because we are CO and you are not!")  From CO.com, I was able to find the rules for the confirmed change: Home &gt; OnePass &gt; OnePass News &amp; Offers &gt; Offer Same-Day Flight Changes  Ongoing Offer Posted Thu., Apr. 6, 2006  Customers holding restricted tickets* can make same-day flight changes for a discounted fee of $50 or a $25 fee for OnePass Gold Elite Members. OnePass Platinum members may request a same-day change at no charge. The following conditions apply:  The itinerary must be wholly operated by Continental The same-day flight change option will be available within 24 hours before your original scheduled flight. Requested flight must be available in your fare class and be departing within the next 24 hours from when you are making the request. Changes must be made prior to your original scheduled flight. You may standby if seats are not available in the purchased fare class. In these cases, the Same Day Change fee will still apply, but will not be charged unless you are assigned a seat on your alternate flight. Changes in routing are not allowed when standing by. Standby may be requested on the day of departure at the airport kiosk or with a Continental airport representative. Once you are added to the flight standby list, you can check your real-time standby status at continental.com/info. Upgraded tickets will be automatically added to the upgrade standby list at your applicable upgrade priority. Once you are added to the upgrade standby list, you can check your real-time upgrade status at continental.com/info. Changes are only available for the exact origin and destination airport. Connection points may be changed provided the new routing is permitted by the fare purchased.   This online paragraph doesn't mention that standby (not confirmed) must be on the same day, while the published fare rules in ATPCO, if I recall do not have the "departing within 24 hours of original" clause, but mention only the words "same day". I am betting that their application is as you state though.   And violist, I am sure yo are more knowledgable on the law than myself. My point was the point that you said you got. The rest was trying to find a legit statute that vocered more than just the morale issue of fraudualantly gaining access to an area with the purporse of doing something other than stated in order to attempt to circumvent additional rules that one knows are in place. But hey, you said an overzealous prosocutor might try that case, so hey, I can't be that far off from the intent of that law. My only legal background is about 15 seasons of "Law and Order", which I doubt has prepared me for the Illinois Bar exam.
Doesn't that stink of many bad things? a) Even if you don't agree with the TSA's policies, you are circumventing their policy by deceit for personal gain (what is the word for deceit of others for personal gain? b) You are abusing UA's inventory (as well as credit card fees) to buy a product that you do not intend on using for personal gain (there is a word for that.) c) You know the rule is SAME DAY, yet you choose to think that the rules of your fare should not apply to you, with full knowledge of what you bought, and the contract associated with it.  UA's standby policy is one of the most liberal out there. Why would you feel the need to abuse something that is already consumer friendly, when many (maybe most) competitors (CO/US/WN) do not have such a consumer friendly policy.   Have you ZERO shame when it comes to your own wants and desires?   (720 ILCS 5/21?3) (from Ch. 38, par. 21?3) Sec. 21?3. Criminal trespass to real property. In Illinois, except as proved in subsection (a-5), whoever: (a) (1) knowingly and without lawful authority enters or remains within or on a building; or (2) enters upon the land of another, after receiving prior to such entry, notice from the owner or occupant that such entry is forbidden; or (3) remains upon the land of another, after receiving notice from the owner or occupant to depart; or (3.5) presents false documents or falsely represents his or her identity orally to the owner or occupant of a building or land in order to obtain permission from the owner or occupant to enter or remain in the building or on the land; commits a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in the county jail, a fine up to $1,500, and/or up to 2 years of probation or conditional discharge.

While the document (a boarding pass for another flight off of a refundable ticket) may not be false, I would bet that just about any prosecutor could make the case that a BP/ticket for a flight that one had no intention of using for it's stated purpose (and by the fact that one did NOT use it to board the flight) might qualify it as such. I am no attorney nor LEO, but I know that when the police remove a "passenger" from the airport at the airlines request, it is most of the time for trespassing along with other charges such as resisting arrest, battery  I choose to look up Illinois law because A) I am here, b) ORD is here, and c) UA is here, but I bet other states have similar laws.
So, the data may be a bit skewed (compared with PRIOR to when we found out all our E500's were going to completely disappear).  The tough part about burning e500s is that you can't sponsor anyone (or at least anyone you're not flying with). I'd love to burn the 7 I've got before they become useless, but I'm not flying until mid-March. A very long drought for me.
There may have been something else wrong that the OP did not notice like the IFE.  I dont like the old C and when I can for intl flights i try to avoid it as it is hard for me to sleep. On a transcon is is great but for a 12 hours transpac it is not so great.
At domestic airports, the priority tag pretty much means nothing and never has.
Well, she should kick it because you admitted to bigamy!
I sort of understand the shame comment, but your credibility has taken a bit of a dive from quoting an inapplicable statute.  A false document would be more along the lines of a Photoshopped BP (which I've heard of happened, and which is a reason why I have always thought that self-prepared BPs are a terrible idea) than a refundable tix, whose use for this purpose might be a circumvention (not even violation) of the airline rules but no more.  An overzealous prosecutor might attempt to make a case of the sort you suggest, but the notion that s/he might prevail is ludicrous - or rather, were it not, it would be sufficient reason to avoid Illinois in general, not just United.
Not anymore. I believe I saw a thread discussing this few weeks ago. I flew UA876 from NRT to DEN via SEA on Monday, and my account summary shows two separate segaments and miles.
I can see why you think it is related to the old C. I flew in old C yesterday, and it was sad. My seat back wouldn't stay upright, no pre-departure drink, and the noise-cancelling feature did not work.  A lousy experience overall.
On 2 Jan our priority tagged luggage was lost for two days on the MSY-ord-muc-ZAG leg.  On the 22 Jan ZAG return leg, we had to retrieve luggage in MUC. It took two hours for our tagged luggage to appear.  On the MUC-iad-MSY leg today, everything went smoothly and the priority tagged luggage, three pieces, was among first off.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
I've got a fairly common surname, a very common first name, and generally just swipe a credit card (normally not the card the tickets were purchased with).  It's never occurred to me before, but I suppose it's a fairly easy way to get past security when not flying - just hope that the person who's name you pick isn't on the no-fly list  It's always better to check in online OR use your 1K card OR simply manually enter your MP account number to avoid this problem.
Wirelessly posted (SonyEricssonZ750a/R1DB Browser/NetFront/3.4 Profile/MIDP-2.1 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 UP.Link/6.3.1.20.06.3.1.20.0)  Wow, that's about 3,500 miles per day. On pace for 1.27 million miles this year, lol.  Don't forget, EQM isn't necessarily BIS. . .
As long as the IAD-PEK NS flight is back go that route. If it stops in NRT avoid it as that route gets a lot of paid traffic and is a VERY hard upgrade. IAD-PEK usually has empty seats in C.
I am thinking given the elite choice awards that DEQM's seem less likely.  (1)There will be a DEQM if American Airlines has one (or)  (2) There will be a fee for registration like there was a few years ago (or)  (3) A lot of passengers temporarily stop flying because they get fed up with all the b/s associated with alleged security. This will cause the airlines a lot of monetary grief from loss of revenue which could trigger lots of promotions.
To get a particular fare, there needs to be filed fare, availablity in that fare class and you need to meet all the fare rules (advance purchase, min/max stay, routing, ).  Likely in this case, for the L fare there is not a filed fare or the fare rules are not met. The existence of Ln, where n&gt;0 is no gauarantee (alone) you can book that fare class.
As no one will ever get to ask you "is this a folding bike in your normal sized suitcase", you will not encounter any issues whatsoever.  And the X-ray guys aren't really in charge of enforcing excessive interpretations of luggage surcharges .  But they may. I have two transportable bikes, an S&amp;S coupled 29er MTB, and a Ritchey BreakAway CX, that I carry in an S&amp;S hardcase (not at the same time of course). While I have never been asked by UA or UX if it is a bicycle in the case, I have frequently been asked what the case contained. I've always responded with "what does it matter? it isn't oversized.", and if they persist I tell them it is bicycle parts (I claimed it was a wheelchair in the beginning, but felt a little guilty doing so. One of these days I'll get a large wheelchair sticker though, and hope they don't ask).  The X-ray guys have been interested in what the case contains, and if you have the chance to help them inspect it (mostly repack it), it's a good thing to do.
Nahhhhh. Not hardly.
The colour of the tag does not remotely impair its capability of getting lost. UA regularly bungles my luggage for a few hours or few days. Lufthansa is even better in doing so.
I don't know this for a fact, but I was under the impression that the United - USA Cycling relationship is a byproduct of the United - US Olympic Committee sponsorship. I wonder how much USAC gets to negotiate directly with UA, as compared to just accepting whatever umbrella deal USOC strikes for all the federations.  That said, I do remember the days when all USAC members could get a few vouchers for free bike travel on domestic flights, and US-based Pro teams got stacks of these vouchers from USAC to help cover the countless bike flights.  And wasn't there a time when on intl flight, the bike just counted as one of your allowed pieces?
Hi all, apologies if this is a newbie question..  Discovered I've got a few days free in a couple of weeks, and thought I might try my first MR. Was looking at some flights with L fares available (according to .bomb), but when selecting the flights the fare is booked into S fare.  I thought L was the cheapest, doesn't everything default to the lowest fare available?  Thanks in advance.
Wow, that's about 3,500 miles per day. On pace for 1.27 million miles this year, lol.
Are you sure about this? I know they enter vouchers differently depending on the type of voucher, so they I'm not sure they can just substitute voucher for credit cards and so on.
The Priority tag is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine(corny I know). On United, domestically at least the tags don't have much use. On more service oriented airlines (LH, SQ, other alliances) the priority tags often have their own bin on widebodies and consistently come out first.
Sometimes when I pick up or drop off friends at the airport, I swipe my card on the UA check-in kiosk. I am always amazed by the random itineraries and names on the screen
Flew LH A330 in C and UA 767 in new C. Personally, even though UA has lie-flat seats, LH C seat setup appealed a lot more to me - I found it to be more ergonomic. Food and service was MUCH better on LH than on UA. Not dissing UA at all - heck, I'd take old UA C cabin over E+ anytime - but when given a choice, I prefer LH.
Wouldn't that be the correct way to handle it  Checking the bags through and charging the non-elite favourite wife the domestic luggage surcharges?  For the return it will probably not be levied as the European agents won't know and care about the luggage stuff for C pax.
And LGA-ORD on 3/9 just cleared last night, booked on 1/1, applied CR1 immediately, L fare, on a A319.
It's already implemented, and it happens many times a day. The technology doesn't care what multiple methods you use to pay; the process is the same whether it's "$100 - voucher #xxxxx, $100 - Amex #xxxxx" or "$100 - Visa #xxxxx, $100 - AmEx #xxxxx" either way you're splitting the payment over multiple instruments, be they vouchers, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, cash, etc.
Technically right now UA elites are entitled to nothing on CO with respect to seats. If you get something other than nothing (CO 'preferred seating' , exit rows, etc.), consider yourself "lucky".
Yes, I would consider it a waste indeed. I am wondering if I am gambling my money on even waitlisting either direction. I wonder what my potential is for not being cleared, at least on the transpacific segments?  Edit: More detail: flts 0837/0881 out 5/23, 0882/0838 return 6/8, all 744s)  Oh also, thank you all for the warm welcome. I've long been a lurker and decided to sign up and post in lieu of my question.
That's nice to know. Thanks!
Hi there, Would love people's opinion on my situation.  Last year I flew 119,000-ish EQM on United. I was aiming to hit the 125,000 mark to get two more SWUs, which I had decided would be my 2010 end-of-year elite bonus award via the promotion for that.  Here's my problem. I had a flight to Germany during the DEQM promotion. On the return, I missed my flight due to irrops from a connecting Lufthansa flight and the only way to rebook me within a reasonable time frame (otherwise I'd be waiting 2 days!) was on an American Airlines flight. I lost my upgrade and such but whatever - I made it home, so am thankful.  That said, the DEQMs from that flight WOULD HAVE put me in the 125,000 EQM mark and earned me two more SWUs, which I consider quite valuable.  I wrote to MP 1K desk and they forwarded my email somewhere (they said). I haven't heard anything formal back yet, but today I noticed that they had credited a bunch of FF miles to my account for the UA flight and the actual flight numbers for the flights I was *supposed* to be on via United are now listed in my Mileage Plus Activity history. i.e. my account now reflects as if I WAS on the originally booked flights.  That said, I have not gotten the 2 SWUs (though I did get about 15,000 miles!).  Should I: a) Shutup and deal. I didn't fly UA metal, UA probably lost revenue by having to stick me on AA metal, so getting the 15k in RDM is good enough. b) Write back and complain further. I hate being a pest, but in reality, my revenue went to United and I got nothing from AA, so I am "entitled" to this c) Call? Does this yield better results? d) Play dumb and write back and now ask why I didn't earn my elite bonus, claiming that my EQMs should have hit the threshhold? (Maybe the computers over there now show as if I was really on that flight?)  I dunno, what to do, what to do The hassle with this makes option A sound really appealing!  Your thoughts are appreciated.
893 SFO - ICN July 10th for two
I've encountered this many times, even when swiping my 1k card through the chicken. Last weekend I was offered several screens of destinations that I had to page through (probably 30 in all) and none of them were where I was headed . My last name is fairly common, but not my first name so I doubt there were 30 folks with the same combination. Its possible that the system goes by last name only.  When this happens I just enter my MP number - works every time.
Do people think this would just be the same as LH SFO-FRA 747, and I should just stick with UA 900, or is the SFO-MUC a340 something I really should try out instead of the UA 900 SFO-FRA?  IMHO, grass is always greener on the other side.  I have flown C on LH 744 and 340. I prefer the A340 because it does not have a middle seat. A340 is very quiet. However, I cannot sleep in its seats. It is slanted and I constantly find myself slipping down.  LH food is only marginally better than UA, but its IFE contents are better than UA's, IMHO.  It is always better to try something different if you have not flown LH C. If trying different thing is not a deciding factor, then I'd choose UA's lie-flat seat over LH. If your choice is between UA 777 and LH, then take LH Cthere is no competition there. UA's old C is just sad!
Maybe April 1st to be exact?
1. ua1flyer will win the first competition each month. There is no chance for anyone to catch ua1flyer's monthly flying activities on UA unless there is someone out there who is not on Flyertalk and is flying more than ua1flyer.  2. The competition is not as competitive and exciting as the "Elite Team Competition".  3. It will be a nightmare for anyone to start a thread keep tracking the status. Potentially any members of Flyertalk.com can enter the competitions. Also, it is easier to track teams as there were less teams. However, FT is only a sample not an population, and there are many roadwarriors out there we don't know about.  4. If we do start a tracking thread, I doubt the ranking would be a reflection of the acutual results. Team competition was a little different, because it was tough to get four people together in the first place and all four had to maintain certain level of flying for 12 months. Both the sample and population were smaller.  Good morningIt is my understanding that with the first competition, one could only win once. There will be 12 seperate winners.
I wonder just how many FTers will win this, I reckon we must have at least 2 out of the top 12 flyers signed up. ua1flyer, you'd get it in January I reckon and would have your 1K nomination in the bag by Easter.  Perhaps we could have a competition on here to win your nomination?
Apparently my original posting used some terms incorrectly I will go edit it.  I should not have said "bumped." I missed my connection because of a Lufthansa code-share from Nuremberg that was late. I was just trying to imply that I was not late due to anything I personally did.  There was a direct UA flight shortly after my original flight but it was oversold, and apparently because Lufthansa was the operating carrier "at fault" United reps could not help me (I tried). Lufthansa said they did not have the power to put me on priority for standby and so I likely wouldn't get on. Nothing else available for (gasp) 2 days on United, unless I wanted to take some insane routings with 2 stops and still be +24hours later then original departure.  As a 1K / *Gold, Lufthansa treated me *very* well in bending the rules to get me on the AA flight and were very nice. I was "that guy" with a line of people behind me at customer service, hogging a bunch of time, while she checked 8000 different ideas for how to route me home. She was awesome, actually. I had never been on AA for any international flights and, unfortunately, I found the AA flight to be pretty mediocre. The terminal for AA in Frankfurt is just insulting to anyone who has to go there. I wonder if I should have waited around on standby for other flights, but again, I'm just happy I got home. The whole thing was kind of a nightmare.
Yeah, CO's SDC is a pretty wide window -- 24/24 -- call/request within 24 hours prior to your flight, and get changed to any flight within 24 hours of your call or request. So realistically, you have nearly 48 hours to play with.  Many people use it to change dates, come home a day early, etc.  Personally, if I have flexibility, I use it to optimize upgrade changes. Since upgrades can be difficult on CO, if I'm on a shut-out flight (or close to shut-out flight), and I see a more open in F flight I can take, I'll switch to that, preferably before the final upgrade runs, and hope for the best.
Jan 20 (Wednesday): SMF-SFO-BWI, in T, afternoon flight, cleared with e500's at 100 hours. SMF-SFO canceled 24 hours out, rebooked on SMF-DEN-BWI, afternoon flight, cleared with e500's (may have been forced by reservations; both legs were half full in F).  Jan 22 (Friday): BWI-LAX-SMF, in T, Friday late afternoon/eve flight on an A320, waitlisted with CR-1 ~10 days prior. Checked in 23.9 hours before flight, was #1 on waitlist with ~2 hours prior to departure.  Switched to BWI-ORD-SMF ~5 minutes prior to the GA clearing upgrades on 757, cleared all the way through. BWI-ORD had at least two empty bulkhead F seats, ORD-SMF was full.  I haven't paid much attention to how UDU's will work, but if it is similar to waitlisted upgrades clearing at the gate and order being determined by check-in time, then I'll need to write a script to check-in within seconds of it being allowed.
SFO-SYD out and back (7 &amp; 14 Feb), both w/l at time of booking last October, both cleared at the 21 day mark.
Family of 4 cleared at time of booking SFO-SIN and back June 3 and July 22 (doing more intra-Asia travel in the interim). Confirmed with all my 6 SWUs and 2 30K upgrades (done just before 1/12/10). Confirming at time of booking was a condition to buying the ticketsand this ended up adjusting our preferred flight days +/- 2 days. The SWUs even work off the child discounted fares.
At the end of the day, it only matters when one makes 1K by 12/31 no matter how many miles one flies pass 100K.  Amen!
28,296 on 1/10
You know, I always thought that the priority tag did very little domestically. But our last flights in Dec. were SFO-MHT and back. At both SFO &amp; MHT, when the bags were tagged, they were missing the orange Priority part that sticks out. When I questioned the check-in agent, I was told they don't do those anymore but if I looked closely at the baggage tag, "Priority" was printed on there. It certainly did not stand out but I took her word for it. This was the first flights in years that we had delayed luggage both ways. Makes ya wonder??
I am 1K she has no status (other than being my favorite wife). She will be leaving from MCO and meeting me in ORD so we can depart from ORD. She is on a free UA voucher from MCO to ORD. Will she be able to check her bags thru to AMS since she has a MCO-ORD free ticket and then a ORD-AMS C ticket?? Will they charge her to check bags?  So you have a non-favorite wife, also?
What about two Dave Smiths or Bill Johnsons on the same flight? This must happen from time to time (even taking MIs into account)
You're probably right, but neither he nor I have been able to ascertain such. Perhaps, it was just a strange fluke.
They also allow you to change (not standby, but change) your reservation within 24 hours for the same booking class for the same sliding fee scale, but again, the same booking class must be available and it is confirmed, not standby.  I don't believe this is correct.  CO does not allow standby if you can same-day confirm (SDC). Only if SDC is not available can you standby, and I believe the same windows apply (+/- 24 hours from your flight). The fare rules may be more restrictive, but in practice it's the same as the SDC windows, which are quite generous.  Downside is, CO charges everyone but Plats for SDC, so there is no complimentary change option unless you're Plat. I heard that they will be extending free SDC benefits to 1Ks once all the reciprocity stuff goes into effect, but at the moment, it's Plat or pay.  That said, SDC is free for all connecting pax when in the connecting point, making a change to the connecting flight. Problem with that is that of CO's 40,000 employees, the self-proclaimed "most professional men and women in the industry," only about two (2) of them are aware of this policy.
If the bags are tagged to an international destination, I would think the international rules apply. The information on the UA website is consistent with my interpretation although not totally clear.
Wandering OT, perhaps, but wouldn't it be nice if UA IT could take a few steps assist the bag claim CSR's when there are missing bags?  Since bags are scanned going into the plane, UA should know in advance of arrival who on the plane had a checked bag that didn't make the flight. At the passenger's final destination, have a pre-printed lost bag ticket available so that all that needs to be added are the few remaining bits if information pertinent to the particular bag and where it should be delivered. Then have a message board of some sort to let affected pax know upon arrival in the bag claim area that they should see an agent to finish the paperwork rather than waste 60-90 minutes waiting around.  This probably wouldn't work 100% of the time, but I could easily see &gt;90% coverage.  LH did this one time when on an LH flight from xxx-MUC-LAX, my bag did not make a very tight connection in MUC. The CSR was standing the TBIT bag claim area with a sign board with several names on it, including mine. She had the papwerwork all ready, I only needed to provide my address, phone number and a bag description. She handed me an amenity pack and I was on my way home in under 10 minutes. What a way to turn lemons into lemonade! (Of course, it helped that I was headed home rather than outbound.)  (sigh) One can dream.
I always understood that between Check-in and loading the bag is at the mercy of TSA and it's their watch that causes much of the delayed baggage.  My only issue is that once a bag is lost/delayed, customer service/mileage plus wash their hands of it and leave it with baggage services. That particular division is the least helpful, most rude and most ineffective service within United imo.  I've had to go the baggage services route twice and they both were very frustration times.   The first time they lost my luggage ORD-LHR for 2 days, which I can deal with, lost baggage is an unfortunate aspect of frequent travel. What followed was a farce where they refused to allow me to buy replacement items because I'm an EU citizen (despite the fact I'm a permanent US resident) and my location counted as home. When my bags did arrive, they arrived 20 hours apart, and the baggage services person refused to have them transported to me individually. The agent told me I would have to either wait until they found my second bag or come and pick the first one up myself (70 mile round trip).  Second time, they lost my bag on Dec 30 coming from Chicago, found it and told me it would be on the last flight in. No bags over night and no toiletries, or anything offered (which I found out should be the policy). I was assured that it would be delivered on the first run the next morning so I took the morning off work. When it didn't come, I called, they told me it was with the delivery service, who they could not contact. They assured me they would call me back by 10am with an update. They never called. I called back, still with delivery. They refused to give me the number of the baggage desks at the airport but told me I could drive in (100 mile round trip this time). Eventually it was delivered at 2pm, so I missed a day of work over it. The thing is, the delivery drive told me (and showed me supporting documents) that they received the bag at 1pm and that I was the first delivery. So I went 20 hours without luggage and got a litany of outright lies from the baggage services department.  I basically told mileage plus that if I ever experience service like that again, it will be my last flight with United. I'll accept mistakes, I won't accept lies.  I flew 79K with United since I joined in Sept, so not 1K, I wonder would that have made a difference (though they never asked for my MP number).
Each ticket rules include both the passenger, as well as the bags for that passenger. A single domestic ticket (and the fees associated with them) and a separate Intl ticket, along with the fees that (in the case don't apply) should be additive, or at the very least as only (1) single transaction is happening at check in, the greater of the individual fees.  That is what I guessed. That said, with a connection to C (free baggage on passenger's own merit, not relying on someone else), and it being all on United metal, you'd also think rational logic would prevail (no charge). And not fall to the silly semantics of which PNR the C segment happened to be on.  Your 2nd example doesn't apply in this case. The OP's better half is transferring onto a C ticket flight.
SFO-SYD 10 Jan. NC1 at booking 2 weeks prior, cleared immediately and op upped to F at the gate.  SYD-SFO 17 Jan. WL then cleared exactly 2 weeks prior to flight.
oops! After reviewing my mileage summary, I see that I missed 1K by a little over 100 miles,so I might have not been first as previously reported. I will however pass the 1K threshold early this morning on my ewr to ord flight.
This has also been my experience. To upgrade JFK-&gt;SFO-&gt;PVG, 1 SWU is required, but miles for each segment have always posted separately, and the segments counted as separate EQS.
If it were me, and I am "Joe by the book", I would charge her and check her bags all the way through. Her tickets are separate, her contract(s) are both separate. Her domestic ticket is as a non-statured domestic passenger traveling without any baggage fee exemption. Just because she has a separate, non connected ticket, to an itnl destination, or plans on meeting a statured passenger on a separate ticket, should not exempt her from the rules of her luggage checking. As far as checking the bags to the final destination, as long as she has both confirmed space, and a valid ticket, then there is no reason to to check them through (and on the chance that the intl tag would have caused an INCREASE to her baggage fee &lt;i.e. overweight, or in excess of the quantity,&gt; she would be liable for whatever that rate would be.  Each ticket rules include both the passenger, as well as the bags for that passenger. A single domestic ticket (and the fees associated with them) and a separate Intl ticket, along with the fees that (in the case don't apply) should be additive, or at the very least as only (1) single transaction is happening at check in, the greater of the individual fees.   Similar logic, but different situation is Joe Blo, who is a 1K and knows Plain Jane, who has no status. Joe is going ORD-FRA in F, and Jane is going ORD-DSM. Does Jane have the right to be in the Intl F checkin line with Joe? No, she doesn't. Does Joe sometimes bring her along to the line without any hassles, possibly, but the two people are not linked other than by knowledge. They are not legally bound by any of UA's rules, and should be handled separately, each according to their separate individual circumstances. So to is Mrs OP separate on her checkin leg than Mr OP, and as such should be treated according to the individual rules that apply to her, regardless of who she meets up with along the way at a different city.  Have fun with your favorite wife in AMS. I know that David Koresh was wishing he could have taken his favorite wife there too, but that would have caused way too much uproar in the compound, kinda like an episode of "Big Love".
Hi, folks. I recently booked a friend PVG-KIX-SFO with miles in C and he told me that apology certs were included in all menus (net result was $200 ecert), and was wondering why. My hunch was that since UA has been advertising its new C pretty heavily, it feels compelled to appease its 777 passengers.  However, if this were the case, I'd expect to see lots of threads on this. That having been said, although I did search before posting, I must admit that I haven't spent much time in this forum during the past year + (i.e. discovered greener pastures).
A lousy experience overall.  I had exactly the same experience last week. I did bring it to the attention of the purser, but no love in the form of whatever we call skykits now.
I usually sleep very well on old C. I think it's how soft the old barcalounger seats are.
Exactly. I mean it's not like someone says, "which bag shall I lose? Better not take the one with the red tag!"
Somebody posted about crossing 25k EQM within like the first week of January. I don't know if he was orbiting or what? I will likely cross that threshold late next week, personally  I was not orbiting. EWR-FRA-MAA-DEL-SIN-HKG-ORD-LGA in C.
Classic post. No need for threads debating the merits and minutae of each of the seats, when you can so effectively describe them with one word or phrase. Nicely done!
A lousy experience overall.  And I flew the old C on Thursday and had a pre-departure drink, the seat worked, and the headphones worked. Usually can't sleep worth a darn on IAD-GRU, but this time slept almost like the proverbial baby. YMMV
I had heard about UA canning about 150 front-line employees. The Chicago Tribune did an article about it recently and the movement towards kiosk help, rather than actual human help..  However, I am still surprised that the bag was "lost". As priority bags are the last to load and first to unload, I would think it should have gone straight to the cart.. Unless it was not loaded at your starting point.
1) The question is straight forword. The place is ORD.  2) Did anyone else with red tag "PRIORITY" luggage had a similar experience?  3) While discussing the situation with CSRs at the baggage claim area I was told that UA just layed off 150 CSRs. There was bitterness expressed by the CRs present. One was just disinterested. (ignored me). The second CSR suggested to me to speak to the computer terminal and see if the computer can help find my luggage - Meaning try to find it without the person-to-person assistance of the the CSRs. The third CSR handled my situation after an hour and the luggage was later delivered home. The issue that emerged was the big bonuses that management gives itself at the expense of cutting CR positions.  4)  I am only trying to do above "Alternative Dispute Mediation" service between management and labor I think that the individual UA employees are generally fine folks.
I realize this, but if I wanted, I could have 40 boarding passes for the same flight all with different seating assignments. If the BP does not scan, they would just normally enter the seat assignment. They should still catch this, however, people do get on wrong flights on accidenthaving a BP for that flight (whether it be yours or not) would just make it easier.  It's never occurred to me before, but I suppose it's a fairly easy way to get past security when not flying - just hope that the person who's name you pick isn't on the no-fly list  It's an easy way to get a boarding pass when not travelingI'd love to know how you plan on getting past security. The names do not always match. I've clicked on the other names before, and the only thing I have noticed were same initials.
Good point, which reminds me of something that I have been wanting to ask: Requesting an upgrade online does not permit segments to be split (at least I have not been offered the choice). Should I then assume that if I wanted to request an upgrade for just a segment of an itinerary, I should call MP? Is "itinerary-splitting" for the sake of upgrade requests allowed?  Thanks
since she was sitting next to me when I posted, I couldnt just leave it as "she has no status" without getting my butt kicked
The baggage was delivered home last night.  I know it was scanned upon arrival and I was told that it is somewhere in bowels of ORD T1. Why won't it pop up on the carousel is a mistery.  This morning (Sunday), I recieved a phone call at home from United, attempting to verify the delivery and apologizing. Thank you United.  Two issues remain - What good the priority red tag does if the baggage still gets delayed or left behind?  Second, the relentless erosion, loss of human CSRs and baggage handlers staff, while at the same time management relies on computers. A human being has to see the red tag on the cart, doesn't it? I appreciate the recent movement in UA to improve customer service But why testing my faith in UA?
I flew SFO-ICN round trip earlier this month. Outbound, my SWU cleared at the gate. Homebound, I chose not to use a SWU but found I'd been op-upped when I went to check in online. (Thanks, UA!)  This week I'm flying SFO-HKG roundtrip. SWUs haven't cleared for either flight yet.
1/10 YVR-SFO, e500 - cleared at 72 hr mark, CR7 1/10 SFO-LAX, e500 - cleared at 72 hr mark, 320  1/20 LAX-PHX, e500 - cleared at 72 hr mark, CR7
I was travelling with the Mrs. a while back on separate PNRs. I swiped her CC to check her in, and it brought up my itinerary. We have different first initials. I had to swipe her DL in order to bring up her itinerary.  But having a fairly unusual last name, I've only had one time when the chicken unit asked me to pick a destination.
Crossed 25K EQM yesterday (Jan 23) on ORD-MIA.  I did not cross 25K EQM until May 3rd last year (had a 300K EQM last year), but this year I anticipate passing 100K in May.
Some (including me) with status have been successfully able to standby a day before the original flight. This means a full calender day before the time of departure. I'd suggest ask kindly at the Gate. But to get through security, you might have to invest in a full fare refundable ticket, which you can refund if things don't work out. Good luck!
*raises hand*  Lost luggage happens. It sucks, but it happens.  I'm not sure what relationship you are trying to establish between the P tag and fact your bag was lost? The P tag is not a panacea for all baggage ills.  The P tag should, ideally, get you quicker baggage delivery at your destination and potentially put your bag at a higher priority for loading should you be on a flight that bulks out or is otherwise forced to leave baggage behind for operational reasons. Beyond that, it's really just another bag.  Some more info about your itinerary would help
So, the data may be a bit skewed (compared with PRIOR to when we found out all our E500's were going to completely disappear).  I think that it might not be that skewed if the determinant of UGs is the inventory and not the number of requests  On a second thought, the frenzy to get rid of e500s might even be a good model for UDU because EVERY elite will automatically be inline for a U/G, which would emulate the e500 U/G request frenzy
A little slow on the ball this year, eh?
Get one of those folding suit things from Goodwill for $5 (the ones that no one ever uses as the clothes end up all creased anyway so they give them to Goodwill). Take the wheels off the bike (even a big one). Stick the frame (handlebars twisted flat), and wheels in. Zip it shut. Check it in flat (not bent over unless you want to bend the frame in two) - the size will be ok (and check that it is). The weight will be ok for sure - especially if you are 1K and get 70lbs.  The truth be known I've only ever done this once and my son was delighted with his new bike.  You're done.  PS And oh - yea - wrap some clothes or towels around everything inside so nothing metal is going to stick out and tear the case or injur anyone handling it.
I've suffered delayed luggage with connections more than anything else, all with priority tags. I've also waited ages at the baggage carousel, watching bags without priority tags (and same nonstop itin as mine, not connection bags) come out before mine. The P tag doesn't guarantee anything, but it's pretty and it helps us feel important  CSRs at SFO aren't all that helpful either - problem is that there are too many PAX with lost/delayed/etc luggage and not enough CSRs to help them. And those kiosks can allow PAX to input the baggage tag number and sometimes indicate that the bag was delayed
What did I do?? Believe me I booked them that second? Thoughts  I booked an SFO-KOA flight for last October for 30K miles it was randomly showing 30K or 40K day to day as a mileage promotion, I waited until the 30K came back and booked it. But your mileage may vary
My wife and I have C tickets from ORD tp AMS coming up. I am 1K she has no status (other than being my favorite wife). She will be leaving from MCO and meeting me in ORD so we can depart from ORD. She is on a free UA voucher from MCO to ORD. Will she be able to check her bags thru to AMS since she has a MCO-ORD free ticket and then a ORD-AMS C ticket?? Will they charge her to check bags?
The selection e-mail for YearEnd EC letter just when out recently to those that did achieve the milestone.  Ahh, you are right! I guess I was wrong in remembering that I actually picked the 2 SWUs for hitting 125k, I must have just thought I picked it I probably was too excited about the available option.  Fair enough. Thanks for the help.
Yes on the first, and 95% chance on the second.  (I'm probably being overly pessimistic on that second one, but I've found that MCO agents are the most incompetent in the system.)
This has happened a few times to me, but ONLY when using a credit card at the Easy Check-in. I think the reader may only capture last name first initial. Then they use destination to try to figure out which "J Dennis" I am.
I am thinking given the elite choice awards that DEQM's seem less likely.
I tried converting them to ecerts at the ORD future ticketing desk yesterday with no luck. I guess I can try mailing them in.
Actually, there is also a 11.25 excise tax on the 15K miles purchase, so that would make it $382.50 for the 7500 bonus miles. It should be noted that one person can buy 13000 miles for $379.38 (more when there is a promo)  So, I don't see a benefit in exchanging miles between the both of you like this. I can earn 13000 miles for $379.38 or less and actually travel somewhere I want to go.
If we both transfer 60K to each other, will we receive another 15K miles each, thereby totalling 60+20+15K miles = 95K miles (for a 60K mile purchase)?  Thanks.  You can only receive 15,000 transferred miles per year, and there is a $180 fee to transfer 15,000 miles. You decide if it's worth $360 to each get 3,750 bonus miles.
Last year my wife and I both purchased 60K miles (with 20K bonus miles to post within 6-8 weeks). I also see that it is possible to transfer / share up to 60K miles and receive 15K bonus miles as a result.  If we both transfer 60K to each other, will we receive another 15K miles each, thereby totalling 60+20+15K miles = 95K miles (for a 60K mile purchase)?  Thanks.
Aerosvit/Ukraine Intl has regular flights between Kiev and Lviv.
You'll be better off clearing customs at KBP anyways, as LWO terminal is very old and small and it will take a long time for you to clear customs there.  supposedly our company has a deal that allows them to let us go through VIP security. Are there good connecting flights from Kiev to LWO?
Thanks, - Nikita  WOW.. within 17 minutes, 2 people signed up and as their first posting are begging for codes. Coincidence? I'm betting they are the same person.
I guess if one has the time, it's possible to go to the other NH club while the noode bar is under reconstruction. Oh darn, they're both being reconstructed at the same timenever mind!
I was at NRT RCC yesterday. There was not wait for the shower.  NRT RCC was packed, but I did not have time to go to the NH Lounge.  I did use the NH F lounge last month, and it did provide a shower kit.  I will be at NRT RCC and NH C lounge next Saturday, and will munch on its hot noodle before the noodle bar closes for renovation the week after.
If anyone is a fan of the NRT NH lounge noodle bar it is out of action for refurbishment during the next few weeks.  NRT lounges temporary service suspension - Jan/Feb 2010
I have the same routine. RCC for the shower and then ANA club for some "real" food.  The ANA lounges have showers, but last time I tried them, I didn't get a neat shower kit; just single-use disposable packets of shampoo and shower gel. On the plus side, the ANA shower rooms don't get nearly as hot as the ones at the RCC.  And just a reminder at the ANA club "we don't make announcements for your flight"  Didnt try the showers at RCC, but can confirm that ANA shower rooms dont have shower kitsjust single use stuff as described above. But, there was no wait at all for the showers in both occassions I used them in January (AM once, PM once).
Anyone gone through NRT recently and used RCC/NH lounges? Same drill? I haven't been through NRT lately. Does RCC still give the shower amenity kit?  Any new additions/benefits?  My standard routine is RCC for a shower, then NH for some food (unless I get distracted by the sushi bar on the way ).  Thanks in advance.  I have the same routine.

No change, but Monday afternoon I was
I don't think your routine has to change at all.
I used the shower at NRT RCC on 1/7 this year, and I got a H2O Plus amenity kit.
Did a couple searches, didn't find anything timely/recent.  Anyone gone through NRT recently and used RCC/NH lounges? Same drill? I haven't been through NRT lately.

Yes. See post 47, above. It's only available to 1st class pax.
Does LH still offer access to the VS clubhouse now that they have their own dedicated lounges?
I went through the IAD IFL last week and about the best thing I can say about it is that I didn't see any mice. Who in the world thinks two blaring televisions are in any way appropriate for what is supposed to be a luxury product?
Wow .. when did that happen? I transferred through IAD two months ago (as I make every effort to stay clear of the hellhole) and I found them fairly discouraging then.  But I will land in IAD in 10 days from now and check them out again, hoping that you are right and I am wrong.
SFO IFL on the other hand had several hot choices and probably 4-5 times the total number of items. 10-11am 3 months ago.  There's usually a food warmer to the right of the espresso machine with various items (sausages, cheese pastries, etc.) Nothing outstanding -- imo the LH lounge beats the IFL when it comes to hot food, but enough options that the trek to the A gates may not be worth it.  I've just checked my pictures from my last trip to make sure I wasn't crazy
Wow Beauty is in the eye of the beholder Yes, the lounges were "renovated." The fact is, they're still awfully dark and depressing, and the red carpet at C7 is already gross and worn out. The D club is still an ugly dark maze. As for spotless bathrooms, I must fly at the wrong times.  I do agree though that service and trash pickup have improved and the staff is definitely more welcoming than it used to be.  Regardless, the Dulles RCCs remain the worst in the system in my book. The IAD IFL is basically what the RCCs should at least look like (minus the hot food, probably.) The IFL should be a step above what it is now and at least offer showers as well as a quiet section away from the TV.
Please call MP and talk to them, I am sure they will take good care of your friend.
Tell him to spend a little time here on FT, so this kind of tragedy never happens to him again.  You're a good friend to post on his behalf
While I don't think it is terrible extortion, I don't see why they wouldn't do it for free as it a) gets them to the destination in the same (or earlier) time frame, b) eliminates a connecting flight from IAD. c) They have more time in Denver that they don't need to be at the airport, and d) there is no REQUIREMENT for UA to "sweeten the pot", although good customer relations is a good thing for UA to try to maintain. Believe it or not, I don't believe that they are doing "UA" the huge favor, but rather the next customer that may not have such an easy reroute, as UA is off the hook based on the CoC passages I Since the OP has an itinerary that could easily be changed to benefit him, in the whole "Karma of life" scheme, a self serving sacrifice by the OP getting all the benefits of points a-c, compared to some other guy who is going DEN-IAD and connecting to a flight where there is no direct service from DEN, I think in is in mankind's as a whole, best interest to have the OP be rerouted. Nothing is lost for him, or another person.  You are right though, the chances of him being denied are slim, and they may offer him something as a good will gesture, but to try to negotiate addl (such as a DBC and free F) when the situation with no addl comp benefits him already, UA, and the next passenger that might get bumped with less reasonable alternatives, is just something I wouldn't personally do. I guess that's just me. To try to take a situation that benefits me, as well as others, and then to try to further enrich myself at another's expense (be it an individual or a corporation) is more than I would do.  There are many things I do in this world that don't hurt me much and benefit others, and I don't ask to get rewarded for it, even if I know I can. Like my go home time when working at the airport. If I am working a flight, and my go home time has arrived and staying a few minutes extra would mean getting a trip out, should I (a) walk away unannounced effectively screwing both UA and the passengers, (b) call UA mgmt and try to twist their arms into giving me things of extreme value for serving the customer beyond my contracted time, and walking away if I am not "made whole" or (c) call mgmt, notify them of the situation, and accept the predetermined compensation covered by my contract for voluntarily staying?  I choose (c), but both a and b are within my contracted rights. (c) has better Karma points, but I guess one could also say that (a) and (b) are both reasonable and legal.  Similar was the summer of 2000. Pilots flew "the contract". End result to both UA and passengers was negative. They were not extorting, they were just working per the rules, to their own interest instead of the society's as a whole. If you were a frequent flyer in that period, was your opinion of UA pilots increased as individuals/a group, or was your opinion of them lowered? So yes one doesn't have to go the extra mile, and one shouldn't suffer for the prevention of suffering of another, but the attempt to enrich oneself using leverage that only can hurt others is usually not viewed by society as a whole as a "Christian" (using the "showing a love for others definition) thing to do.   I would ask for full mileage though if nothing else is offered, as the direct route may actually cost him a few miles earned.
Don't get me wrong. The OP, as a 1K, would be extremely unlikely to be IDB'd. They are actually doing UA a huge favor by taking the alternate flight, as doing so would be their prerogative. I don't think that negotiating the standard DBCfree and and confirmed F is in the least bit 'extortion.'
BTW, it looks like the plane was downsized to an int'l 767, a net loss of 61 seats.  Me personally, I would take whatever they offer if it is reasonable and not try to "hold out for more" as their is little leg to stand on for that in this situation. If I was in your situation and they treated me with respect and offered a solution that met the needs of my original ticket without undue hardship to me, I wouldn't try to extort too much. It has happened to me on Lan Peru, and it was due to oversales (not equip sub), and I didn't extort anything, as I was rushed onto an earlier flight that got me where I needed to be 30 min earlier. What compensation do I require when I was made whole already?  EXCEPTION 1: THE PASSENGER WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION IF THE UA FLIGHT ON WHICH HE/SHE HOLDS CONFIRMED RESERVED SPACE IS UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE HIM/HER BECAUSE OF SUBSTITUTION OF EQUIPMENT OF LESSER CAPACITY WHEN REQUIRED BY OPERATIONAL OR SAFETY REASONS.  also, EXCEPTION 5: THE PASSENGER WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION IF UA ARRANGES FOR COMPARABLE AIR TRANSPORTATION (OR FOR OTHER TRANSPORTATION THAT IS ACCEPTED AND USED BY THE PASSENGER AT NO EXTRA COST TO THE PASSENGER) WHICH, AT THE TIME EITHER ARRANGEMENT IS MADE IS PLANNED TO ARRIVE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE PASSENGER'S NEXT STOPOVER, OR IF NONE, AT THE AIRPORT OF THE PASSENGER'S FINAL DESTINATION WITHIN ONE HOUR AFTER THE SCHEDULED ARRIVAL TIME OF THE PASSENGER'S ORIGINAL FLIGHT OR FLIGHTS.
The agent is probably just being overly cautious by stating that you may be denied boarding. Its a true statement, but a bit provocative in the way it was delivered.  Sounds like a perfect opportunity for a VDB, a DBCFREE ticket in your pocket, a potential F seat for free, and an early arrival at your
On a route like DEN-IAD, it always makes sense to rebook the connections to non-stops if possible. This route is very heavy with locals and it makes more sense to rebook them on the remaining DEN-IAD nonstops. If I were you, I'd get to DEN soon and negotiate a DBC and F on DEN-LGA.  BTW, it looks like the plane was downsized to an int'l 767, a net loss of 61 seats.
Today, I am scheduled to fly DEN-IAD-LGA (leaving DEN at 3:54). When I tried to log in online for my flight, I noticed it wouldn't let me, and I also saw an additional flight on my screen (DEN-LGA direct leaving 1 hour later). I called the 1K desk, and he claims that the flight is heavily oversold, and they may deny me boarding. He also said the direct flight is in there as a backup, but I am not confirmed on that one. I'm just curious why he would say that I may be denied boarding (And yes, I would take a VDB).
YES!!
My favorite is the Fire Rock pale ale- $40 per case.
Thanks dimramon that's what I thoughtThank you very much guys for fast and accurate responses can always count on flyertalk!
More information is available on united.com.
Yes
It is a small screen in the back of the seat in front of you (in Y). In C you have the screen on a movable arm attached to your seat. The entertainment is several movies/TV shows that play repeatedly over several channels. No 'on-demand' video. Choices are usually pretty decent though.
It's small personal TVs (the pop up kind), with a block of different movies (~8-10? I never watch them) running at the same time. Then once all of them are done they rewind the tape and start over. Not AVOD like the new config.  Hope that helps.
Hey guys,  I tried to do a quick search but could not rely find any tangible info. Am travelling iad-fra soon on a 777 in C and was wondering what the entertainment is like on board. I have expericenced the new entertainment systems on the 47's but since the 777 are still in the old config. not sure what to expectjust overhead projectors? handhelds? Should I just bring a good bookThanks in advance!
Congrats. Save your $39/head on the lame DEN RCC and spend it on good beer at New Belgium Hub between the main B Concourse and the B Commuter terminal (head towards gates B80+ and you can't miss it). Great new restaurant from the (formerly) local New Belgium Brewery.  Just my opinion, don't want to start a beer holy-war, but they're quickly turning into a big national conglomo with homogenized tasting beer, but still head and shoulders the best place, I feel, to spend time/money and dine in DEN (and their beer is still be the best you'll find behind security DEN, I think, there's a Boulder Brewery in the Terminal, which is actually very good truly local small-batch beer).  Personally, I'd take the worst seat in The New Belgium Hub over the RCC in DEN anyday (even with a membership, so at no cost). The beers in RCC are $7.50even the premium tap at New Belgium Hub is cheaper.  I appreciate all the helpful answers to my questions.  I checked on changing flights to move to a better plane and everything that connects from MCI to OGG is a 767-300 so no luck there. I'm pretty confident that we'll be pleased as we're not terribly large or tall people (5' 4) and I actually have leg room in coach.  Regarding the RCC club access in DEN it is disappointing that you can't count on reliable information from any representatives these days. I did a lot of reading around this board and that seems to be the consensus regarding the UA staff. I specifically asked the agent on the phone if I had to purchase day passes and she put me on hold for several minutes and returned to inform me that because I was paying an F fare that I would have access. After reading reviews I wouldn't drop the extra $ for some snacks and soft drinks anyway. However it would be nice if it was included. What I don't want to do is show up at the door (after being misinformed by UA staff?) and be admonished for trying to poach my way in to a crappy RCC lounge!  Also the agent told me she confirmed that there are "working" power ports at all the first seats on the flight. Looks like that will be a crap shoot.  Thanks again!
Any reason United is covering them up?  Congratulations to the OP btw!

I agree that its hit and miss on the A320's and 757's, but I flew a fair number of domestic 767's last year, all had operating empower. Specific to DEN-OGG, I had 3 RT's last year in addition to other times on the 767.  Despite the reduced width on the 767's, I find the seats to be better then some might suggest. Enjoy the trip, and don't let the negative comments from some ruin your excitement!
The RCC will get you trail mix, free soda, free internet and a comfy chair. While it would be nice, it's probably not worth the cost.  The majority of time the power adapters are not working, so I wouldn't plan on them.  Very good point! DEN has a number of restaurants and bars that you can kill time on your layover in.. Below is a link to the restaurants in DEN and a map of the terminal.  Have a great trip!
While you could buy a couple of passes to the Club, I don't possibly see how it's worth it for a few hours. Find one of the restaurants, sit down and have a meal to kill a major portion of that time.  The RCC will get you trail mix, free soda, free internet and a comfy chair. While it would be nice, it's probably not worth the cost.  The majority of time the power adapters are not working, so I wouldn't plan on them.
If your tickets are flexible and can be changed without a service charge you might consider going via ORD, SFO, or LAX to avoid that 767. It's earned it's nickname "ghetto bird" and it has the worst first class seats in the entire fleet. The seats are 19" wide, just 1" wider than coach and a really small drink table. Lousy overhead storage bins too. Larger bags only fit in the side bins, not in the bins over the center section. The 2 class 777's have 21" wide seats, a much larger drink table, nice big overhead bins, and the cabin is more spacious. I'd even choose a narrow body 757 over the 767.  Don't get me wrong.. first class on a 767 is still better than coach and if your tickets require you to pay a change fee then it's probably not worth it.  Regardless, have a great trip and happy anniversary!
Congratulations again. Note that UA has been covering up the Em Power outlets for a while now. You would have to be lucky to actually get one, even if you did have a converter.

The problem with F vs C is that ORD-AMS is a not-such-a-long flight to justify extra miles. With that in mind, if you do not need those miles, then go for it, but I suggest you find an LH flight departing as late as possible to a US gateway to have more time to enjoy the FCT or FCL! Also, if you hold an F award, there may be an option to re-book via NYC and snatch a JFK-FRA in F on SQ, but in my experience those seats are released one a time so it helped me when our reservations were in two different PNRs. SQ F allows entry into a VS Clubhouse at JFK
2X25K.
YMMV on the outbound. Personally I like the F seats better than the C seats if in a new config, but prefer the old C to old F. Service attentiveness tends to be better in F, and improving on UA, but it is still variable. Food and drink is the same.  On the return on LH, absolutely upgrade if you can get it. Whereas on UA F is only a little better than C, LH F is significantly better than LH Ceven if all you do is go to the FCT. Since you are flying as a couple, the LH F works out very nice.  People complain about the seats and cabin temperature on LH, but it's never bothered me. Since you are flying them you might as well go F!
Thanks. I dont think my outbound flight from ORD to AMS is on the new config. The site and my current seats detail a 777. thats why I'm considering the upgrade.
Ord-AMS in UA C FRA-ORD in LH C  Is it worth the extra 30k miles for each of us to change to F both ways?  IMHO, UA C seats on new configuration are more comfortable than LH F seats. IFE is also far superior on UA C than on LH F. You can look up details on their respective websites.  Liquor and food will be considerably better in LH F than UA C but if you are a teetotaler or do not like caviar then it won't matter.  Service is a very personal issue. I prefer UA (sometimes) friendliness over LH efficiency.  FCL (and FCT) in FRA is excellent but note that you can only use it if you fly LH metal.
It depends. As the others have noted, you'd get a chance to try the new UA First Class suites, and get the Lufthansa goodies (First Class Terminal, private car to the plane, LH F seats &amp; service). However, these are not very long flights (compared to Asia or Australia). That's a lot of miles for a bit more comfort and the LH F services.  If you have extra miles to burn, and you think you'd both enjoy the F experience, then by all means, do it. However, the amenities in C on these flights will be very pleasant.
Another vote for F and the extra 30K, especially since you are on LH on the return.
If you have the miles, I would go for it. F is nicer than C on both UA and LH. The LH first class lounges in Frankfurt are really cool and worth the experience. If F is not available, C is good enough to make travel comfortable.
And what's the remaining 20%
Good advice, except that the OP mentions the return is on LH! And, as you suspected, because the entire ticket is award, it has to be either all C or all F.  I would definitely go for F. More personal space on the outbound, and the FCT on the return!
According to the suitedreams site, the outbound is the new configuration and the return is the old. So I would leave the outbound in C and the return in F, if a combination of differentf awards is allowed -- although I think it isn't.  I know there are plenty of folks here who will say you should experience F, but what I have found is that service in international F on UA is just as variable as in other classes -- i.e., there is a 5% chance it will be great, and a 75% chance it will be mediocre or terrible.
I have confirmed award tickets for wife and I at 105k each. Currently:  Ord-AMS in UA C FRA-ORD in LH C  Is it worth the extra 30k miles for each of us to change to F both ways?
Presumably, US cannot gain the needed distance by offloading passengers -- or, in the bean-counter approach they've perfected, they've determined that it's to their financial advantage to take the revenue, avoid IDBs and reroutes and just make passengers suffer through an unscheduled stop and the resulting 2-3 hour delay.  I wonder if a fuel stop in LAX or SFO en route from DEN to HNL won't get it for UA, or if they've just decided it's better to bite the bullet and inconvenience 20 people, rather than everyone on the flight. Now there's a thought.  I think it is a significant difference in distanceCLT LAX, DEN-LAX; so the need for the UA DEN-HNL to refuel probably doesn't come up that often on a 767.  UA can shift passengers in DEN to DEN-LAX &amp; DEN-SFO if they have room LAX-HNL or SFO-HNL. USAir can access those flights too in LAX, but will cost them.
A little over a month ago, US started non-stop 767 service from CLT to HNL. Many times, those strong headwinds have forced a refueling stop at PHX or LAX. Here's a thread about it.

I dont remember enough of my weather classes to know for sure, but I have seen strong jetstreams in both the day and at night.
As I am sure you know, brakes essentially work by converting kinetic energy into potential energy. That is, they convert the forward speed of the aircraft into heat. The brakes have a certain amount of heat they can store. This is the maximum brake energy. All airliners have some method of measuring and displaying in the cockpit the temperature of those brakes. (not usually in actual degrees, but rather in units such as 0-9) Brake energy usually comes into play after an aborted takeoff or after a landing and then a quick turnaround for a take off. Although on hot days with long taxi distances, you will brake temps rise. Typically there will be a chart in the cockpit which the pilot will refer to when the temps start to rise. Lets say the brake temp indicator shows a 4. We will go to the chart and it will tell us that we cant take off unless the aircraft weighs below a certain weight. If we are below that weight, we can go. Otherwise, we have to wait for the brakes to cool off. This guarantees that if we have to abort the takeoff, the brake will be able to absorb the amount of energy we are asking them to absorb.  Clear as mud?  Clear as a rocky mtn streambeautiful! Thanks!  Lets seeto get back to the windsI wonder if there is a noticeable difference in the day flights from HI to the mainland verses the night ones? Or is wind not impacted by the sun?
Sure, although it has been awhile since I have studied the technical aspects of this so if I get something screwed up, go easy on me!

My point is that just because you have a longer runway does not mean you can take more weightit is much more involved than that. Thank goodness for computers and dispatch!!  It is complex. I understand the Koch chart, and a laymens understanding of what you mentionCould you talk more about brake energy?
Longer runway does not really mean higher speeds. Weight (and some other factors such as altitude and temperature) determine speed. A longer runway gives you the pavement needed to accelerate to a particular speed at a particular weight. In my experience, tire speed is always above the highest rotation speeds. There are many factors that determine how much weight a plane can take off with. Tire speed, brake energy, runway length, engine out climb performance, drift down (if you lose an engine enroute, you have to be able to maintain a certain amount of terrain separation as you descend), even the climb rate with one engine inoperative at the destination in the event of a missed approach must be taken into account. My point is that just because you have a longer runway does not mean you can take more weightit is much more involved than that. Thank goodness for computers and dispatch!!
Infinite runway just bumps into tire speed ratings or braking capacity (in event of takeoff abort). Leaving weight behind is the proper solution. This is a constraint inherent to all high-altitude airports that dream of ULR flights - ask the staff at JNB.
This winter has brought particularly brutal headwinds. I flew from LAX-HNL in December and the flight took 1 hour longer than normal. This has been happening regularly (at least once or twice a week) on Hawaii flights this season. Additional comments can be found in the Alaska Airlines forum (their SEA/PDX-Hawaii flights on 737's have been routinely making fuel stops in OAK) and the US Airways forum (their new CLT-HNL flight has been frequently stopping in PHX or LAX).
I know that AA 7 DFW-OGG momstop has been running about 45 minutes late the last few days - I am leaving Tuesday for OGG, and plan on drinking plenty of Mai Tais on the way there
I flew OGG-LAX on Wednesday. We had 200+ mile/hour tailwinds. We got to LA in about 4:15; we were &gt;45 minutes early.  Smokin'!
Yes, the Russian Antonov 124, sometimes carrying heavy mining equipment to be repaired.  Thanks for thislearned something today.
Rarely is the length of the runway the factor which limits weight. More typically it is the one engine inoperative climb ability. The flight may have needed this runway, but it was probably weight restricted because of climb restrictions out of DEN.
So, Hawaii pros: are these headwinds par for the course in the winter or was my experience out of the ordinary? Any bets on whether I should get to the gate early for this flight or have another Fat Tire at the bar before boarding?  Last week was an unusual period of a sustained batch of storms (5 in a row) one a few hundred miles after the other in the Pacific and blowing like heck to the east. This particular setup is not really usual, so it's not likely this is a good bet for getting bumped.
Over the last six or seven years, I have seen a number of cargo aircraft from different countries landing or parked in DEN. A number of times they have been from Russia
DEN's sixth runway (16R/34L) is the longest commercial precision-instrument runway in North America with a length of 16,000 feet. Compared to other DEN runways, the extra 4,000-foot length allows fully loaded jumbo jets to take off in Denver's mile-high altitude during summer months, thereby providing unrestricted global access for any airline using DEN. The sixth runway can also accommodate the new generation of massive airliners, including the Airbus A380 &amp; the space shuttle in an emergency.  Wonder what heavy cargo is being transported?  It's funny you mentioned this because the flight crew made mention that we had to use that runway and that runway only to take off. As the runway was assigned to arrivals at the time, we had to wait for about six planes to land before they could slot us in for takeoff.

Paging aluminumdriver please?
Almost all airplanes have to make a compromise between fuel and payload. Full fuel and full seats are only available on a few. The -ER (extended range) planes that fly the longest routes sometimes have a reduced seat capacity to create that range. Headwinds just add to the problem.
Have to look deeper into this since  DEN's sixth runway (16R/34L) is the longest commercial precision-instrument runway in North America with a length of 16,000 feet.

It's the headwinds in combination with the altitude of DEN and the MTOW of the 767.
Not unusual at all. In the winter months, the jetstream moves farther south and is generally stronger than in summer months. Just check out flights 43 and 1 today, both are running about an hour behind due to winds.  Also, it is not uncommon this time of year to see east to west transcons make fuel stops in DEN and STL due to the winds.
I was on UA 43 (DEN-HNL) last week and they had to bump 20 pax due to a weight restriction created by 150+ knot (or is it mile?) headwinds most of the way to the islands. Indeed the flight took off on time but landed close to an hour late.  Regrettably, I could not partake in the bumpfest as I was on a tight schedule (and that hurt since I am out of vouchers) but I will be on this flight again in mid-February while on a family vacation and am wondering if there is a legitimate chance of a repeat of this situation.  My wife is a reluctant bumper at best but if given enough lead time to warm to the idea, I think I can get her onboard. On the other hand, if the odds are long, I probably wouldn't mention it all and spare everyone the anxiety.  The ground staff at DEN told me that weight issues are not unusual on UA43, which I find odd since it's operated by a 763, which I would hope would have the legs to get to HNL I am hardly an airplane expert, however.  So, Hawaii pros: are these headwinds par for the course in the winter or was my experience out of the ordinary? Any bets on whether I should get to the gate early for this flight or have another Fat Tire at the bar before boarding?
Must have been the 1230pm (delayed until 345pm) flight yesterday. It isn't even listed on UALs website anymore (for ontime stats) A coworker and I were on the 5pm to Vegas and almost stood by on the delayed flight  Hope everything was okay.
This was happening at BWI and ORD in the first week of Jan. At BWI there was extra TSA agents randomly checking pax while queuing at the gate. At ORD there were FBI/DHS? guys with dogs walking around B &amp; C. Did quite a lot of scanning in the end of C concourse by the starbucks.
I was at DEN last night waiting for my mom's late inbound flight from MIA. Her plane then continued to LAS as UA 779. As I was waiting at the gate, I couldn't help but notice that at least four TSA agents were walking through the gate area and giving extra scrutiny to the passengers in the waiting area (no actual stops or searches that I saw, only a lot of hard stares at people's carry-ons). I wonder if this action was related to the IAD-LAS incident.
What's up with sending women to the back and men to the front (as reported by ABC7). That makes no sense whatsoever.
What was in the bag?
* Go ahead, try to open the plane door. For inward-opening doors, you'll tear your arms off before the door budges. Knock yourself out.  * Only men are capable of keeping an eye on the person? I've seen men I wouldn't trust to watch a hamster, and women who could kick your butt. Careful there, UA

Yep, sure he did. He could be charge the interfering of the cabin crew. He is not appropriate for his behaviors but, he is trying to open the aircraft door. He is not entry into the cockpit. Because the cockpit doors has already locked. He can't be entrance into the cockpit but, he didn't have any weapons onboard the aircraft.  What about these passengers were restrained him to get down on the floor. When the F/A is called captain and they will be automatically to be diverted to DEN. The local authorities is waited for him and they will be removed him off the plane immediately. He could be serious trouble during in-flight. He could be banned for flying into the commercial airplanes for 6 to 12 months.
A United Airlines flight from Washington Dulles International Airport to Las Vegas was diverted to Denver Saturday after a passenger walked to the front of a plane carrying a bag and tried to open an exit door in flight, passengers said

its wan't when the guy didn't answer, it was when asked what was in the brown bag (only one of two carryons he had) he brought to the front of the plane he responded: "You'll See", yeah hes lucky a little arm twist was all he got.
My only concern is the comment from the passenger that yanked his arm harder when the guy didn't answer, and sounded very proud of himself. Sounds great, but in practice the onboard vigalantism can go too far - hopefully it doesn't embolden some [idiot] to play hero where it's unnecessary.
He was seen drinking a bit, and taking pills of some sort -- wonder if the side effects of the self-medication played a role? But, quick action by other passengers worked.
However, it is very lame that i) the RCC passes are "sold out" so quickly and ii) none of the people I had called at MP customer service seemed to be aware of this problem.  Come to FT for answers that even MP CSRs sometimes cannot provide! I am glad things worked out for you. !  D.-
Thanks much! It did indeed work out this way, However, it is very lame that i) the RCC passes are "sold out" so quickly and ii) none of the people I had called at MP customer service seemed to be aware of this problem.
I've been calling the MP 1P line several times about it and was always referred to UA web support where I explained my problem. Again, several times I've been told that the problem was taken care of and I could expect results within 48 hours. However, nothing has happened for a week now and the selection period will end in early February.  Any advice as to what I should do?  Someone else appears to have experienced the very same problem: EC site 'experiencing problems'. You might have initially selected the RCC passes, but they had run out of them, and the system got confused about what to do next. Below is what s/he posted after s/he got to the bottom of it. Good luck:  The other mystery is also solved: Once I chose a different reward for my "regular" Elite Choice award, I was able to submit it all the way through and got a confirmation. Then, when I visited the site again and logged in, it showed my additional "Year End" reward choices. So I think you do have to do it sequentially (at least that worked for me)  Hope this helps some of you who had the same problems as me.
When I checked on 1/2 I actually had 500eqm from the ORD-OMA flight I took on 1/1. Haven't called to check on my balance since I did get the 125K (but not year end bonus) email. Would rather let 1KVoice try to sort it out before investing time on phone holds. Hope this helps. Keep us informed as will I.
As many of you I received two emails from UA in early January informing me about my possible 2009 elite choice rewards and year end rewards options. Since that time I've been trying to select my rewards but always got the same message from the website: Once I re-enter my email address and click "submit" it tells me that the "site is currently experiencing problems, please return at a later time". I've been calling the MP 1P line several times about it and was always referred to UA web support where I explained my problem. Again, several times I've been told that the problem was taken care of and I could expect results within 48 hours. However, nothing has happened for a week now and the selection period will end in early February.  Any advice as to what I should do?
Although I do mostly intl travel and, as a *A Gold, I get access to lounges at major intl airports, I decided to burn 40k RDMs this year to join RCC (just got the membership card yesterday) simply because I get RDMs so easily from the long intl trips+the 100% elite RDM bonus. RDMs simply aren't that enticing for me as I can regenerate them rather quickly, so I think that I will keep rejoining RCC for access during my limited domestic trips. Seems like as a good way as any to burn miles that come so easily. Between the *A lounges and RCC, I think that I am now covered almost worldwide regarding airport lounge access.
Burn SWUs domestically and am lifetime RCC (happens when you cross over 2mm on UA), so took the miles. My kids always have weddings and other trips to use my miles -- balance seems to be stuck in the 500k range even when I'm adding 300k or so annually.
If you have a lot of domestic travel, the free RCC might be something to consider as well.
Can you please link to the eastern time cutoffs that refer to Elite Choice. Must have missed that post.  If I request them by midnight Chicago time and they tell me I am 'too late' a quick email to 1KVoice will sort that out I am sure. In which case they will be deposited in MARCH for sure.  No loser possible in that scenario.
I have about 1.5 million UA miles and never seen to use many up, so interested to read how many choose miles over SWU's.
If you're flying domestically and not interested in trading for the SWUs, you can always use them for domestic upgrades. No miles and no co-pay when using a SWU for a domestic upgrade.
I also chose the miles. All my flying will be domestic in 2010 (except for award travel) and I am wary of coupon connection (for no reason - other than it is just natural for me to worry).
I picked the miles too - mine still haven't posted.
No guess is necessary. Whenever you have a question like this, you should check the Terms and Conditions on united.com. You will almost always find the answer there. Per united.com:  Member will receive 25,000 redeemable Mileage Plus miles. Miles will be credited to the member's account four to six weeks after reward is selected. Miles are redeemable miles and do not count toward elite status.
Have the same decision to make Any guess on how long for the 25k miles to post after selection?
When you checked your eqms after the posting, were your 2010 eqms at 0, or did you have some there? If you did not, that's a great sign. Have you called United to see what your 2009 balance was--because you can't see it after 12/31?
Same. While I've read that each SWU can go for 25k mi, I've personally opted for the miles for this promo. Less hassle and zero risk
I have realized with a new focus this year, i will not be travelling internationally much this year - maybe 1 paid intl for vacation - but other than that - I do not forsee using my SWUs. Without reading all the fine print, Im sure like everything else, these are void if bartered or sold - so of course i would never sell the ugs - maybe sell some 1K consulting advice - with a complimentary ug. Still havent chosen my 125K benefit - but leaning toward the 25K miles as opposed to 2 more SWUs I wont end up using. What have others done in this situation?
[is SJC TLV via LAX. And yes, we'd take LAX TLV non-stop and get ourselves to LA another way.  AA has available SJC DFW LHR TLV.  I'm going to look at where we maybe could go one stop from either DFW or LAX - is there a prefered tool for doing that, seeing all the destinations from a city, by airline?  I think trying to do this during school's winter vacation is not a good idea, but I'll give it another few days. (Although Israel is preferred, we might take any international destination, an adventure.)  Thanks for sharing the pain!
Jan 25: IFL/LAX 10:30-11:00am
Anyone avail? Plz email me  if you don't mind sponsoring  Does ord have *a clubs that *g can use? Like the senator at iad or singapore at sfo?
I wonder why TK wouldn't build the YYZ service to daily before launching YUL (even though YUL does have a fairly significant Lebanese/Middle Eastern population).
Thanks  Agree with KevinS. What time is your flight?
How is the security line at SFO since December 25th? I know VX is still going out of the Internation Terminal so I thought maybe there was more security now. Should I budget more time for my departure?
The AMEX Plat website and membership guide states:
By the way, I flew into DOH yesterday, and while we were taxiing to the stopping area, they made an announcement that I had never heard before. They said something to the effect of, if you have a short connection, and have a "short connection invitation," please see the ground staff for assistance in getting to your transfer bus.  I couldn't make out exactly what they were saying, but perhaps they offer some sort of special service in such cases? Maybe shuttle you through security then directly to transportation to the next plane? That would be nice.   You are absolutely correct. If you have a tight transfer, you can altert a Qatar Airways staff upon arrival!
There is a message on DC-area Safeway receipts now showing that Safeway is dropping the United program.  Maybe another grocer is about to start?
and your post has now been moved to the Lounge Access Help Desk thread from the AC discounts thread.  /Moderator  That sucks. With how much the JFK - PLS itinerary costs most of the time, they should throw us that bone Definitely not worth another $100 on top of the ridiculous cost of the fare.  Thanks for the info!
I would not agree re SYD. Europe-Australia has some pretty competitive fares, considering the distance, brought about mostly by the added competition from EK and the like in recent years. Note that quite a few European airlines used to fly to Australia but now only 2 do (BA and VS). A combination of low yields and high operating costs (e.g. related to long crew layovers) have made this route difficult for European carriers.  We will see whether TK succeeds. AFAIK there is not currently an a/c that can fly nonstop IST-SYD so - as has been pointed out - the flight will have to go via CGK. This makes is a 2-stop flight from Europe, which is unfavourable compared to the multitude of 1-stop options on either BA/VS, or the Asian carriers (TG, SQ, etc) or the Middle Eastern carriers (EK, EY, QR).
3:30pm today (Sun Jan 24, 2010). Is there an easy way to determine what other flights are scheduled to leave around then?
I think I found it on flightstats.com and it looks like there is an Emerates and Eva Air 777 departing around then and and AF flight to Paris as well. That's not good. I wish there was a line devoted to VX.
Thank you all  They are essentially the same seat; there are a only very few A332s with older style business (very similar to the current) --which is also equipped with the latest AVOD but a bit older style. Chances are you are getting the newer ones.
Lounge access while flying non-rev? Either domestic through Amex platinum or international through oneworld status. I didn't see any specific mentions of a paid fare requirement for either.
Exactly..
Is possibly the only thing I dislike about VA right now. How security is depends almost entirely on the timing of other flights.  If you get a flight that is running about the same time as a megajumbo jet heading to Asia, security can be backed up with lines of hundreds of people, many of whom unfortunately aren't fluent English speakers and not many TSA folks are polyglots. Combine with unfamiliarity with our security procedures here, and it can be a long day.  If there is no intl flight at same time, security is a breeze though, and the terminal is certainly orders of magnitude nicer than Term1 or Term3 at SFO, particularly as regards food and shopping distractions.
From the European perspective Sydney, Ho Chi Minh, Manila, Sochi and Novosibirsk are very valuable additions. All those destinations are only served by very few European carriers and fares are often unduly high. Well done TK!
Was on a flight two days ago that saw the video, but another earlier in the week that did not. Since the promo ended Jan 15, has anyone else seen this? Must only be on a few aircraft?
Safeway's Vons (and I suppose Pavillions) has joined the defection from "GroceryMiles"
Right, the bus. At least for C class, it's a small bus that leaves with all of the C class passengers, instead of waiting for more passengers to load. So that saves a couple of minutes.  By the way, I flew into DOH yesterday, and while we were taxiing to the stopping area, they made an announcement that I had never heard before. They said something to the effect of, if you have a short connection, and have a "short connection invitation," please see the ground staff for assistance in getting to your transfer bus.  I couldn't make out exactly what they were saying, but perhaps they offer some sort of special service in such cases? Maybe shuttle you through security then directly to transportation to the next plane? That would be nice.
Thanks for the swift replies!
Dear wise AA folk, may I ask for your indulgence to help a newbie from the UK! (I have checked the FAQ)  I am about to book a pair of tickets MIA-SJO in July of this year. It's an extension of a LHR-MIA redemption on BA (the BA Amex 2-4-1 rules won't allow me to add the MIA-SJO sector).  There is an outside chance that work will mean I have to cancel the trip.  In Europe, I would have two choice, buy a flexible ticket and get a refund if necessary or buy a non-refundable ticket and live with the loss.  From what I can see, AA are a little more sensible and will allow me to buy a non-refundable ticket and cancel the reservation which in turn will create a travel credit. My questions are these:  i) Do I need a particular reason to cancel?  ii) If I cancel, I will end up with two credits which are valid for a year that are non transferable  iii) I can use the credits for a UK-US ticket instead, I am not tied to a particular route or region?  Thanks in advance.
These sorts of discussions are really better suited for the Mileage Run Discussion forum, where the MR experts can weight in. Accordingly, members are encouraged to take a look at that forum for relevant threads.  Off-topic exchanges have now been removed and this thread is closed.  /Moderator
Mr Tiki and I both got our miles today! I guess I should unsubscribe us now?
Good advice. In fact it's a little known secret at the Call Centers to intentionally
The general consensus here is that LH C is better than UA C. Well, frankly, both suck on an international C standard. UA's new C seat is *much* better than LH's seat, however, and on that route you're very likely to have it. UA C, in this case, over LH C.  In F, UA will again have a vastly superior seat, unfortunately, LH does have vastly superior service. On the overnight, I'd take UA for the seat, on the return, LH for the service.  And yes, a UA SWU can be used to upgrade to C on LH, but standby only, and it is not a risk I'd take.  I' flying SIN ORD and the twochoices I had was LH SIN-FRA-ORD or UA SIN-HKG-ORD. I went for UA as the new C seat is better and I will have it on that route. I had mediocre food in C on both and the blatantly arogant and snotty UA FA I had on ORD-HKG the last time was outweighted by the way better (Asian) crew between SIN &amp; HKG and vv.  Until LH makes C fully flat (like new LX C) I will go with (yikes) UA who are also cheaper for that trip. However, I agree that overall LHs soft product is definitely better.
Not to my experience. It's slightly narrower and hence more nicely arranged plane than the 747 in Biz. And the myth on this board is that the MUC crews are a superior breed to anything else  but that's about it. No, not really. I had uber-unpleasant, arrogant, 'letat-c'est-moi type young UA FAs who are in urgent need of being fired  but they inconvenience me for seconds when they dump the meal on my table or do not bring me drinks. That is nothing to what annoying pax inflict upon me or what an oddly shaped seat (that's you LX, yes) does to my beloved behind.  I take wider, softer seat in exchange for a crew assembled from parolees any day.
exactly the info I needed  thank you very much, I will PM you shortly  --Russ
So you mean the LH LDs also work as Cerberi in other lounges?
The OP was getting on a bus at MUC, and although I have no experience of a bus ride at MUC I don't expect it to be very different from getting on a bus at FRA.
A very interesting discussion re language competency vs. culture. I don't speak as many languages as vbroucek but have used English which is my second language 24/7 for most of my adult life. I don't expect vbroucek to think in anything other than English when speaking in English and neither do I.  But (to bring the discussion closer to FT ) almost the only time I find it awkward to be addressed in my mother tongue (Japanese) is on the plane. I fly mostly on LH and since my German is very limited I get by in English without any problem. On flights to/from Japan there are usually a few Japanese FAs who naturally address me in Japanese and that's where my problem starts.  In popular wisdom Japanese are considered to be very polite and there's no shortage of "polite" ways of saying things in Japanese. However in everyday use between grown-ups even among strangers, spoken Japanese could be considered quite blunt or even rude by Western standard. Japanese hardly say "please" or "thank you" or their equivalents when, for example, making a meal choice on the plane, handed a hot towel or served food and drinks or when your meal tray is taken away. It's even worse when I'm addressed in Japanese by non-Japanese FAs with a smattering of the language. On the whole I play it safe and try to respond in unnaturally polite Japanese.  I agree with vbroucek and Flying Lawyer that this has more to do with how language is used in a specific culture rather than language competency.  While I'm OT, I've noticed that on the English language First Class menu on flights to/from Japan (they have slightly different menus from other longhaul flights even ex-Germany) LH use "Choice of main courses" rather than "Entrees" but interestingly on C Class menus they use "Entrees".
yeah, I think I will still apply my own judgement to situations that involve my children
Ah yes, I overlooked that part of the question. Exchanging stickers for miles could be useful here if one is close to the next MM threshold and had no other use for the stickers.
So based on my knowledge and people skills, I think it would be waste of OP's time writing complaint about unidentified person saying something that OP cannot actually repeat and substantiate in any way  FWIW, I too was wondering why everyone assumed the OP was a female. I looked up previous posts and it appears that the OP is a male.
Of course you should.  I have 5 kids , all grown up and healthy by now . Did a lot of traveling with them during the years . If you get your head out of whack for an incident like this , you are in for a major emotional ride in years to come .  Relax , sit back and enjoy the ride.
Mine was mixed.  The first biz lounge desk agent we happened upon - a male - was a dour sod however the Senator lounge agents - all female were absolutely wonderful.  Gate staffunderstaffed and in need of help were just plain rudecaused through stress I suspect.
Non-AA related, but we (Mrs. JDH and I) got to be extras in one of his movies recently. He was very easygoing over seveal hours of shooting. It was a once in a lifetime, behind the scenes Hollywood experience. Dwayne (AKA the Rock) Johnson was extremely easy going. Great time.  BTW, Mrs. JDH is a huge KC and the Sunshine band fan. I must say, I've enjoyed the 4-5 times we've seen them in concert around the country (thanks to AAdvantage miles).
Not true, they are separate projects and separate teams. I think I probably know more about the 748 than my friend who is an engineer on the 787 project. Although I will say that Boeing has been cannibalizing hangar space that would usually be used for assembling 747's (and all other planes for that matter) to speed up the production of 787s.
Maybe there is an issue with trade unions regarding this?  That's usually the rasons if things go wrong in Belgian Transport industry (buses, trains, planes)
Despite not remembering the exact words, I can say for sure the behavior and tone were not appropriate (and even more so as the guy knew he was also waiting for two more pax), so the only advice I was really looking for was whether to write a letter or not. I think I will. .  Appologies for the answers you obviously did not want to hear. From the story you told I can only say you are to my opinion absolutely overreacting. If you feel better when writing a letter, do so. But if I were in charge of the complaints department and would be confronted with this complaint, you would certainly get a nice boiler plate language reply (if any).  As a side remark: You are not talking about comments of educated German "bosses" but about a gate agent. The same gate agent in the US would certainly not speak any foreign language and even his/her English could be something my Oxford friends would consider to be a native dialect.
However, I just heard that Korean Air has ordered 5 passenger version of 747-8s  Correct, as reported in this Boeing, Korean Air Announce Order for New 747-8 Intercontinental press release, dated 4 December 2009. These 5 are in addition to orders for 7 freighter versions of the 747-8.
Its worth a letter. I once wrote to the chairman of Southwest Airlines about an issue that in hindsight was less important than your issue and I got a personal reply.
I am Gold with SK and I have a number of LX and LH flights booked. All tickets are booked with my SK profile.  What is the experience of getting points to a M&amp;M account if I change FF program at checkin??  I consider changing to M&amp;M if I know that I will reach Senator during 2010. But I will not succeed if miles is splitted into both SK &amp; M&amp;M
And to see it from the other end: There were 50 pax waiting on that bus and one late pax starts to foster her child instead of boarding the bus. The agent could not know that it would have been done in "10 seconds" (whar I do not believe) and not bringing this scene on speed would have certainly been very bad customer service for the other 50 on the bus.  In my native Glasgow the normal way of telling someone to hurry up goes something like "shift your f a". I doubt if using thebut that's the way Glaswegians talk would be an acceptable excuse to explain why those words were used in order to tell a customer to hurry up.
Are you at all aware that you (I know there were two others as well) were holding up a bus of about 50 passengers? Others being even later doesn't mean that the others weren't inconvenienced by you as well. These 50 passengers were probably waiting in a cold bus (doors open to let you in).  So because Lufthansa is an international airline, every employee has to be perfect in English because they took your American dollars? I think you stated you flew on United so I assume United took care of cashing your American dollars, not Lufthansa. Next time I buy a ticket on Lufthansa (German carrier) and I have an onward connection on UA, YOU better make sure all the United employees speak perfect German with me (I am happy if they can manage to speak English properly).  My ticket was a Lufthansa ticket. I said I was on UA metal. Assuming is a dangerous game, as you might have heard.  I never said I expect the guy's English to be perfect, as I said English is not my first language either This is my only response to your messages.
I studied High German for two years while in CH but never had to use it, really. Can understand a bit of Schweizer Deutsch, I can order at a restaurant and say "merci vielmal", but not much more. So, I definitely could not enter an argument in German with a gate agent. Plus, not sure how this would be relevant, he addressed me in English.  and English is not my first language either.
2. If I was treated this way as a customer of any other business (bookstore, TGV, hotel), would that treatment be acceptable?  No answer for the original poster, just general thoughts.  Good point. And the answer iswell of course not so why should we accept it when purchasing another product? Have we become so accustomed to being bossed about airports nowadays that we should see that behaviour as being acceptable?  I must say I'm surprised to see so many here seem to think it is perfectly normal way to treat a customer. God help us if that's the way forward.
Ok, this is all different. This is 15 Meters through the heated corridor, down the heated steps, two meters between the door and the bus, not under cover. But it certainly explains even more the pressure: In MUC you need a minute or two from the gate to the bus. With a child (I have done that way with a stroller) it can be two or three. And if all other pax are already in the bus, standing outside for what is maybe ten minutes and already late mum starts to unpack the little one's jacket and pampers the little one, I might get a bit nervous too.
So you do dismiss the possibility that the agent was actually serious and that you actually and factually were stalling the boarding process to the bus?  Unless you have hard evidence that the agent was sugary sweet to the two pax who delayed the whole process even more, I'd first assess if the comment of the agent - sans tone and gesture of course - wasn't warranted. Or at least justifiable at that very moment.  It might be hard for an agent who's in a rush to understand why one has to don up for entering a bus after all.
Well, OP asked our opinion if she should write a letter or not. I gave her mine.  We can discuss whether my tone has been appropriate or not but it somewhat reminded me of too many threats about people complaining about rather minor stuff. Also, "on a related note", if I would ask for an apology in the name of other flyertalk members each and every time, you rather insult anybody here or make them look stupid, I'd be quite busy. If you, dear flysurfer or the OP don't like my post, please feel absolutely free to report me to the moderators if you wish to do so.  I wrote that if I would be LH and receive letters with complaints like that, that I couldn't care less. They should absolutely train their employees in a general way to not behave like that but should they track down each and every single employee each and every time a customer complains with circumstances like this. Once in a while, it can't be too much trouble for a customer to open her mouth herself and rather tell the agent to reconsider his behavior than some customer service rep sending him an email about an incident a couple of weeks ago. If the own acting doesn't help, then one should consider going by the way of complaining officially. First attempt of solving "problems" should always be on the own and in person, if this doesn't work and it's truly important, then do whatever is necessary.
I will be travellling from DEL-LHR on 9W and then connection onto a domestic UK flight on a separate. The Jet Airways website says that through connections are possible on BA  but we all know that this is India and it can't be so easy.  Has anyone done this before? Was it easy enough on two etickets? Did they give you a boarding pass for the BA flight at check-in as the website suggests is possible.  What is the minimum connection time that they accept?
Definitely not. But we talk air travel here. So you have to ask yourself: would that kind of treatment be ok if administered to you by a warden in a Supermax prison complex? And suddenly your urge to complain will vanish  Always keep in mind that as a pax you are the prime suspect in an unspeakable crime which yet has to happen.
The Jet airways website still suggests that they have a through check in agreement. I will call them to confirm and update.
It'll mean something to people that watch/watched Dad's Army.    I'll get me coat.
I was joking.
If you use the self-service check in kiosks at Arlanda and press "change bonuscard", you will alo have a good percentage of flights getting credited to both programmes :-)
Didn't some small cargo aircraft slid off runway in STR the other day as well?  Yes it did. I ended up spending the night in Zurich after the flight to STR was canceled.
Sure, but be prepared that not everybody here or in airline industry shares your opinion. I have travelled with kids, so I know the situations, however, I know the other side of the coin too.
Greetings - Dirk  agree, for some reason my reaction at the time was just to ignore the remark and still take my time to do what I had to do before walking out, so I can't change that, it all happened pretty fast.
[Thank God for direct languages.  Not acceptable in any language.  It is possible that an incident described by OP should warrant a complaint , at the spot . I can not believe someone would not shrug this of her shoulders in 15 Minutes.
Thank you for getting the FA fired before he or she had the opportunity to ruin my (so far) 100% pleasant encounters with Asian airlines staff.
Well, as a father let me say so much: If anyone would tell me to walk outside in the cold with my 4-year-old without proper wear, I can certainly tell you that I'd have solved that situation on the spot, and with the responsible flight manager to make sure it's adressed properly if this gate agent would have started to threaten me after my brief response on this completely unreasonable request.  Greetings - Dirk
I cannot complain about them either - I think this was exceptional, but then again, it shows, one cannot generalise
Complain and a*$hole? The facts the agent gave were obviously correct. You were already late notwithstanding who was responsible for that. Certainly neither the agent nor Lufthansa nor the other poor people waiting on that bus for the departure.  The agent could have said "Madam or Sir, would you be so kind to enter bus, we are a bit behind schedule and the others are already waiting". However, the agent is not a native English speaker and if the German language capabiltiies of all pax were as good as the English language capabilities of that agent, his/her life would be by far easier. A UA agent in the US would not have even dreamed about adressing me in a language different from what he/she believes is English. What he/she said in English would have been normal in German, even more normal in Bavarian: "Machts inne, ihr seits ohnehin recht spÃ¤t dran": I would not have been offended in any way.  If I had been a pax on that bus and waiting there standing, maybe even for already 10 minutes, I would have understood the care for your daughter as provocative. It was already late and a late passenger delays the departure of the bus and puts the slot into jeopardy.
Two questions:  1) Is 90 minutes enough time to change from the Intl to Domestic terminal at DEL (1445hrs to 1615hrs).  2) Is there any safe, reliable ground transport available at LKO?  Thanks.
I doubt if using thebut that's the way Glaswegians talk would be an acceptable excuse to explain why those words were used in order to tell a customer to hurry up.  There is a difference between Glasgow slang and normal educated polite German. You might understand our language as such as slang but rest assured, it isn't. German slang would be similar to the Glaswegians'
Absolutely true. My "most" native language (the other two are not that interesting and my familiy is much more familiar with these than I am) is German. I work with a UK law firm, so my working language is British (London) English. Half of my clients are Canadian, the almost other half is US American. Sometimes I start to speak German but with an English "sentence pattern", sometimes I use more than often "nicht wahr" or "oder nicht" at the end of a German sentence.
I had the same belief before.  However, I just heard that Korean Air has ordered 5 passenger version of 747-8s
To be fair to the OP: how do you plan to learn German in Switzerland? Unless you are stuck in a research institute, it is not an excessively common language there.
I doubt if using thebut that's the way Glaswegians talk would be an acceptable excuse to explain why those words were used in order to tell a customer to hurry up.  right.  as I said already, I don't recall the exact words. therefore I am not going to comment on speculations about the possible German translation of an English sentence I don't exactly remember.  tone, posture, attitude and content of the remark were, in my opinion, unacceptable. I believe even in a German cultural context they were meant to be rude. in addition, Lufthansa is an international airline, they happily cash my American dollars, so the fact that the gate agent was German is irrelevant to me.  I do not believe that writing a letter to the customer service is, as a general rule, a waste of time. Hopefully if many customers complain about the quality of a specific aspect of a company's service, management will take action to improve, that's all I am after (pretty straight forward). I am not after compensation, as I had no damage (not even a bruised ego, as many people seem to imply )
That makes me strongly wonder which carriers you are using as of late and what kind of special meals you are ordering ?  And one emergency landing in your flying career ? Jealous! The very first LH award I booked my friend on emergency landed in a country she had no visa for  made for a memorable flight and I had a hard time getting her on the following 3 segments on LH .
What ,this is serious stuff. You address a question to the LH board and expect it not taken seriously , who are you kidding. This board is full of professionals , super frequent flyers , linguistic experts ,lawyers etc ,all completely unbiased . They will take every post to their heart and dissect it in to its smallest particles , analyze it and come up with the correct answer or opinion.
It is not language as such. It is how language is used in a specific culture. Germans have a tendency to be very short and direct, so the German use of English - may it even be grammatically correct - tends to be very short and direct too; often missunderstood as inpolite or rude eg by the British or Americans.  I remember my days as a young student in the UK. Being asked, "did you have a good day" my plain answer was "yes". The minimum expected would have been "yes, I had" or "yes, I had but it was better yesterday" or "yes I had, but it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain" or even "yes, I had but it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain but we can expect that the sun will be shining tomorrow." or "yes, I had bit it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain but we can expect that the sun will be shining tomorrow - but how was yours."  Most Germans will culturally not do it that way and they will certainly not do it that way when using a foreign language.  I believe the story of the OP (if we forget about the second half with "go without your jacket") is a perfect example. "Beeilen Sie sich, Sie sind spÃ¤t dran" would not be anyhow offensive in Germany language (Flysurfer can certainly properly put this into the idom of the northern alps). However "hurry up, you are late" is understood as being rude.  Just think about this v/v, The UA Captain introducing himself with "Listen folks, I am John Doe and I will fly you guys into Frankfurt today". Translated literally into German "HerhÃ¶ren Leute, ich bin John Doe und ich werde euch Typen heute nach Frankfurt fliegen". Languagewise this translation would be correct. In the US, John Doe's announcement would not be surprising, however, if John Doe was transferred to LH and - after learning his poor German at high school for two years - tries to express himself with that statement, most people without a good command of English would somehow be - at least - surprised.
Send the letter and while I have your attention, please end this Health Care crap VOTE NO to the government running it. We have medicaid for those who can't get it on their own.
Indeed. You'd save your complaints. And that's why if you had posted what the OP has posted here today, my advice to would have been to take a hike. You, as a litigation lawyer, certainly should not care about such "pity stuff". But mysteriously, the OP did. That's why she opened this thread.  Remember, my advice was not directed at you, but at the OP.  I offer different advice to different people. That's the beauty of not overgeneralizing.
flysurfer, are you at least for second willing to accept that perhaps OP did not even hear correctly what was said. OP actually admits it by saying that "something along the lines". OP was certainly also stressed by nearly missing the flight and perhaps over sensitive to what has been said? I am not making apologies for LH staff and I am not saying that we should tolerate if they are rude, but I am actually saying, that perhaps it was not so bad. And what would that LH employee think about being called "a*$hole". Doesn't he/she also deserve certain level of social behaviour. And do not forget, presumed innocent until proven guilty. So, you do not buy the language barrier argument, I do not buy yours. We are now fifty fifty :-)
Great stuff. More than 50 posts in this most useless thread. Amazing, what emotional beings Flyertalkers are
I certainly don't buy this excuse for a split second. Whenever I have to deal with Asian ground crews who often do NOT speak perfect English (and neither do I, my language skills are the poor result of several classes I was taught in a Bavarian school located at the edge of the Alps, but I try), they always manage to be kind and friendly. Usually with a smile. Language barriers? Now please somebody give me a break!
So true, dear supermasterphil, and that's why I'd never crawl to a moderator and report a bad post, I'd just finish you off myself, quick and clear, flysurfer style.  Only that your advice was not really about the question, it was rather telling the OP that she was unable to handle her life and other nice things. IMHO, there's a difference between thinking this stuff and publicly writing it down.  Now, while Flying Lawyer has a longe FlyerTalk history of absolving rude LH staff by mentioning their allegedly incompetent language skills (which would, if true, in fact be another valid point worth complaining about), I stand by my advice.
Yes, IMHO, the agent's behavior, as described by the OP, is not acceptable. I would certainly not have accepted it. However, I would have made that very clear on the spot.  Since the OP did not do that, the only remaining option is to write a letter. While it's doubtful that it will have any positive effect, at least she's tried and that might ease her mind. In hindsight, those ten seconds obviously had a more profound effect than expected. That's not unusual. Sometimes, what happens in a few seconds can even change your life.  On a related note, statements like supermastphil's are not acceptable, either. First of all, why should the OP give him a break? In what way is he involved in this matter, anyway? If he doesn't care about it, why does he even reply to this topic? And why is his reply not helpful at all, but a borderline personal attack? Basically, he's telling the OP that she is unable to handle her life. That she has too much time on her hands and is not occupied. Additionally, he's ordering her what to complain about and what not. This is quite peculiar, especially since supermastphil made it very clear that he "couldn't care less".  So if I was the OP, I'd not accept that, either. I'd demand an apology.
Well, referring to Gulag, perhaps she misunderstood your 777 for AK47
Well, if having anything to do with Gulag, be it good or bad, then she would be in clear favour
You shouldn't have a problem with 90 minutes in the middle of the day, its usually quite quiet at DEL during that time. FWIW, I've had a flight pull into the gate at IGIA around 5:20am, made it on my domestic flight that departed on time at 6am.

What I know is that we have a OP who appears to be bothered by an episode that only lasted ten seconds. Still, the incident keeps nagging on her, so from her perspective, it must have been severe. She wants closure, so she asks for our advice. Hence I offer my advice: Since the OP didn't take the opportunity to clear the situation on the spot, the best option is to write a letter and "digest" the episode by doing so. This is my specific advice for this specific OP, based on my psychological judgement of her specific post.  Honestly, how can OP (btw, how do you know OP is female? You continue refering to OP as she) complain if OP does not even know what was said? And really, was it really necessary to do what she did? Could not she wait until they were in the bus?  So based on my knowledge and people skills, I think it would be waste of OP's time writing complaint about unidentified person saying something that OP cannot actually repeat and substantiate in any way
I did not take the name of the chap, which I am regretting now.  Sorry to hear about your bad experience with LH (it was most likely not LH but a handling agent in a LH uniform). Such a behaviour is not acceptable to me (but I must say that you don't get any better in the USA). In your case I would take the time and complaint. However, be prepared to be ignored by LH. Most likely they will send you some blah blah blah standard letter.
I wouldn't bother to complain. You were probably stressed at being late, the agent was probably under pressure to get the flight out on time, there was an exchange of words, end of story. If you are still upset, write a letter to LH.
I personally try to write to airlines about both good and bad things and I do it regularly. However, OP does not seem to know what exactly has been said by the staff in the question, as the OP says 'something along the lines "you are already late, do not stop, just go outside without jackets".' nor what was the name of the staff. And then the OP behaves even worse, calling that staff (who might have been under lots of stress as it is now in freezing Europe with delays etc) "a*$hole". So personally, I don't think that OP has any rights to complain, unless he/she also apologises for his/her own behaviour.
Just show your M&amp;M card at check-in and make sure your BPs say "M/M" rather than SK*G - then you should be fine. Don't count on last minute changes at the gate - they are bound to go wrong. You can always show your EBG at the lounge to get accesss etc.
Complainyou help to pay their wagesyou're doing them a favour not the other way about.  Too many airline staff use the "confrontational issue" nowadays as an excuse to get their own way. In other words it's alright for them to shout and be rude to you but as soon as you in any way question them then you are accused of being a disruptive passenger.  It's the modern way of training airline employees especially on short haul. Time is money so the quicker they can boss you about to do what they want you to do the more money they save.  If it had been me I would have walked as slow as possible.
I support what Flying Lawyer said about language barriers. We all have to realise that translations and language skills can vary a lot. As an example: 1) There is "Fasten your seatbelt while seated" and "Bitte," in front of you. Sorry, I do not recall the rest of the German text, but important point is that in German it is very polite, in English it is less polite. Do I care or complain? No, I do not. 2) On many longhaul flights the 'hauptspiesse" is translated to English as "entrees". That is correct in US English where they use this term for main meal, but complete rubbish in all other variants of English where this is used for 'entree' in original French meaning Do I get confused? Yes, I did but extremely obese yankee sitting next to me (luckily in business) kindly explained this subtle nuance to me Do I complain or care. No, I do not. BTW, later on I was told by purser that LH receives lots of complaints about this translation, but US being their main destination, they rather use US English than UK English.
Hello,  I was looking at the Miles &amp; More Status Levels to check out status qualification criteria and stumbled over a footnote.  For example, for FTL, the "How to qualify" row says:  Footnote 1 is crystal clear to me, but footnote 4 really doesn't make sense to me, at least I don't know how to interpret it:  How does this relate to earning Status Miles to achieve a higher status? Can anyone shed light on this?  Thanks! -Christian
You address a question to the LH board and expect it not taken seriously , who are you kidding. This board is full of professionals , super frequent flyers , linguistic experts ,lawyers etc ,all completely unbiased . They will take every post to their heart and dissect it in to its smallest particles , analyze it and come up with the correct answer or opinion.  yes, I am starting to learn that, moving from silent lurker to member to
If you don't have a name to attach to the complaint, you will receive a standard apology. If you expect them to track down who might have been the person who "did this to you", I would not recommend to hold your breath  In other words: If you'd like to spend half an hour of your life (including the time you already spent for this thread) in order to receive a canned answer: Go right ahead.  Otherwise I would just recommend to ignore what happened and live on. I would not give a grumpy airline employee the power to insult me. I decide whom I take seriously and whom I just forget a milisecond after the incident.  Your call
I do not complain about emergency landings - they have potential of saving my life
Unless you have hard evidence that the agent was sugary sweet to the two pax who delayed the whole process even more, I'd first assess if the comment of the agent - sans tone and gesture of course - wasn't warranted. Or at least justifiable at that very moment.  It might be hard for an agent who's in a rush to understand why one has to don up for entering a bus after all.  yes, I do dismiss that possibility. I think the guy was just taking his frustration out on me, quite honestly. not a big deal, just he should not be employed in a customer facing role.  P.S. Yes, I have some time on my hands right now, sue me
They used to be able to check you in on a connecting BA flight, but I don't think they do it anymore - there've been changes to the 9W-BA partnership.
I would strongly discourage you from doing this.  I fly to LWO every third week (primarily via WAW) and here's why I'd recommend either an overnight in Warsaw or exploring other options. While in WAW you, in principal, should be able to make that connection (since LWO bound flights are often held in case flights from the US/Canada are delayed), in LWO check-in agents are somewhat incompetent. It was not until last year that they actually started printing luggage tags (before that, they, together with boarding passes, were handwritten). So, unless (s)he sees LWO-WAW-CDG in your booking, chances are very high that the agent would not tag your luggage to CDG simply because (s)he does not know how to. I tried this once on LWO-WAW-FRA (having 3 hrs in between) and the agent said, very apologetically, that she did not know how to. This was 5 months ago, so perhaps by now things changed. But  Furthermore, if your connection time is 1:05 and you are on two separate PRNs, you will need to take care of check-in formalities. In order to be flagged in LOT's system as "checked in", you need to finish check-in formalities 60 minutes before European flights. So, your options are: either doing an online check-in for WAW-CDG flight while being in Ukraine or hoping that your LWO-WAW arrives early enough to WAW so that at transfer desk in WAW they can check you in.  Also, I assume you are talking about PROMOLOT fares. It does not mention anything in T&amp;C about checking through on two PROMOTOL fare tickets, but I would not be surprised if they say that because you have this type of fare, through check-in does not apply.  One of the options, if I may suggest, is booking your flights on Mon, Wed or Fri. There is a second WAW-LWO flight on these days which departs at 15:15. So, if you take a morning flight from CDG and connect to 15:15 for LWO, you should be fine on two separate PRNs.  Another option would be to start a trip in FRA. Booking FRA (or DUS)-WAW-LWO-WAW-CDG, you should be able to get a total fare of 380 USD.  Let me know if you may have any other questions concerning LWO and Lviv, customs, forms, taxis, hotels, food etc. I will be there in two weeks (finally going to a place with central heating), so if you need any tips, feel free to PM me.  Enjoy your visit, Russ.
Arrived at the gate just in time, and before walking outside to board the shuttle I stopped to put my daughter's jacket on, as it was 0Â°C (32Â°F) outside. The Lufthansa agent who had just checked our boarding passes started barking at me, saying something along the lines "you are already late, do not stop, just go outside without jackets". I ignored the a*$hole, did what I had to do (which took me about 10 seconds) and boarded the shuttle. As it turns out, we were not even the last ones, there were two more folks who arrived a couple of minutes later.  I don't hold grudges and do not want to appear too sensitive, but the Lufthansa agent's behaviour kind of made me upset.  Should I write Lufthansa a letter of complaint? I hate the whole "you-don't-know-who-I-am" approach, and I am nobody anyway, but I do have Senator status (for what is worth) and my daughter and I were booked in business for the trip - parameters which by the way should be irrelevant in this matter, I think the barking agent's behaviour was unacceptable, period.  I did not take the name of the chap, which I am regretting now.  In line with what some of the others have said..that's Germany, that's Frankfurt, and social mores of politeness are different around the world..you need to expect to come up against behavior you are not usually exposed to. Germany doesn't have a "Culture of Complaint" like the US does..where every unusual tone is followed by demands of justice from the employer.
As said before: The agent's statement translated into German was to my humble opinion neither inpolite nor rude. In particular you as a British should know about the directness of German language by all these rubbish series' on UK television about WWII. If nothing is correct in these episodes, it is correct that the original use of German language is short and for a British or American ear often inpolite. For a German it isn't. This does not change if a German who learned English as a second language starts to speak English.  And to see it from the other end: There were 50 pax waiting on that bus and one late pax starts to foster her child instead of boarding the bus. The agent could not know that it would have been done in "10 seconds" (whar I do not believe) and not bringing this scene on speed would have certainly been very bad customer service for the other 50 on the bus.
Come on, give me a break. Yes, it was rude but just to think about it twice shows that you have too much time or nothing else that keeps you occupied. If every disturbing ten seconds are that tough to you, how do you handle the rest of life?  If I'd to read letters like yours ten times a day, I certainly wouldn't care less. Complain about real problems.
by the way, my rather trivial initial question seems to have generated a lot of posts, I am not really intending to make a big deal out of this, just killing some time (back home visiting my parents) and it did really happen.  I don't want to enter arguments on an anonymous board, so I am not going to answer to posters who seem to imply that I am lying about what happened, that I am going to have issues growing my kids if this episode scarred me so bad (it didn't, I mean, this is a bloody board, please) etc.
I am about to book a pair of tickets MIA-SJO in July of this year. It's an extension of a LHR-MIA redemption on BA (the BA Amex 2-4-1 rules won't allow me to add the MIA-SJO sector).  There is an outside chance that work will mean I have to cancel the trip.  In Europe, I would have two choice, buy a flexible ticket and get a refund if necessary or buy a non-refundable ticket and live with the loss.  From what I can see, AA are a little more sensible and will allow me to buy a non-refundable ticket and cancel the reservation which in turn will create a travel credit. My questions are these:  i) Do I need a particular to cancel?  ii) If I cancel, I will end up with two credits which are valid for a year that are non transferable  iii) I can use the credits for a UK-US ticket instead, I am not tied to a particular route or region?  Thanks in advance.  Depends on the fare rules of the ticket you will buy. Check the rules before you buy. Most, not all, AA non-refundable tickets can be cancelled, before the flight and get some type of credit (not a refund) voucher good for 1 year. There will be a large Penalty (maybe $150-$300). The balance will be held in a credit voucher account that can be used for any AA flight for a year.
So you think she was in favour or against AK47s ? I mean they even happen to me when I do not fly LH! But I fully agree with you that the language barrier never is the issue. Otherwise the service on NH would not be that great as they never understand one word what one is saying.
I had the pleasure of travelling with person who is white Europeand but fluent Thai speaker, when we were welcomed on board of Thai aircraft in business class in what I though was very polite manner. Only after my companion explained to me what was the heated exchange he had with the purser about, I learnt that the very polite welcome was actualy finished with two very rude and racist thai words Well, that FA is no longer working for Thai Airways So, please, do not overgeneralise
100% true, but because the OP asked:   we should note that of course any miles received in exchange would count toward million mile status, as all RDMs from any source do. (For now anyway, Lord willin' and the creek don't rise.)
Oh no, these things never happen to me. They always happen to you, and you only. You are doomed, and you know it.
You can cancel for any reason, but must call before the departure time of the first flight.   That is correct. The penalty on MIA-SJO flights usually is $150, so you'll have two credits valid for one year (I think from the date of purchase, not the date of travel) equal to the amount you paid for each ticket minus $150. Also, although AA generally can access this credit by means of your AAdvantage number, it's a good idea to note the ticket numbers (not the reservation numbers; the ticket numbers, which will start with the numbers 001), which is an easier way for them to find the credit when you go to use it down the road.   Correct.
I completely agree. The staff in HKG smilingly denies you any request even if you have it in written and signed with the blood of a dying unicorn. And the SINg-SINg employees try very hard to decipher what you could possibly imply with "change my seat" as the seat number on the boarding pass was endowed upon them by the almighty computer and hence beyond questioning by mortals. I would have agreed with you until my recent security session at FRA by a security agent planted there by UA. She had an accent like a Soviet Gulag administrator from a Cold War movie. I made every effort to decipher her semantics in questions along "Yesh, yesh, but I ask you once mohhhr, why are you using this plane". "Because I like the 777" wasn't what she wanted to hear and so I got interrogated by a superior
The one and only emergency landing I experienced on a F100sin 30 years of heavy flying ended up to be a result of sloppy maintenance. So yes, my life was saved, and no, I had all reasons to complain because the situation could have been avoided.
As I said: DOOMED.
I'm even willing to accept that the entire story is made up. What do I know? What do you know? See: We know nothing.  What I know is that we have a OP who appears to be bothered by an episode that only lasted ten seconds. Still, the incident keeps nagging on her, so from her perspective, it must have been severe. She wants closure, so she asks for our advice. Hence I offer my advice: Since the OP didn't take the opportunity to clear the situation on the spot, the best option is to write a letter and "digest" the episode by doing so. This is my specific advice for this specific OP, based on my psychological judgement of her specific post.
The Mrs purchased a Ford Edge Limited.  She's happy (over the moon) and to me that's priceless.
Do take note that any new ticket needs to have travel that has the same Country of origin as the original ticket (with, presumably, the EU being considered a single country in order to comply with its economic framework), but as long as it originates in the same Country as the original ticket it can be any routing. Therefore you cannot use a MIA-SJO for a UK-US ticket.
And if I had been already waiting for that bus departing and you were already late for the boarding, I would think and perhaps even utter "Hurry up you idiot"
Innocent? Airline staff? Never? Flysurfer has already spoken
This must certainly be the reason for the sometimes apparentely rude attitude of your posts. But rest assured, I absolve you too . Seriously: I travel too much to care about every small fly in a salad. I safe my complaints for the real reasons like ten hour delays, emergency landings, downgrades from F to Y or the guy next to me cutting the cheese.
Amausi airport (LKO) has a Govt run prepaid taxi counter. Its inside the terminal on left of the exit gate. They only take INR.  However, 90 minutes is too tight at DEL as you have to clear the immigration and collect your baggage too.
And that's why I, as mentioned above, tend to offer different advice to different people.
So based on my knowledge and people skills, I think it would be waste of OP's time writing complaint about unidentified person saying something that OP cannot actually repeat and substantiate in any way  That's what I wrote in my initial reply.
You can always call the LH and LX call centres and ask them to change the FFP number on the bookings.  Is there any special reason why you still need the SK*G number on the bookings before departure? Because otherwise you can raise your chances of the miles ending up in the correct programme by getting it done ahead of time.
I wouldn't worry about it - bad English is the language of the word after all .. and you became a temporary victim of the FRA dialect of that language structure.  I am just jealous that you obviously have not been more and more consistently cussed at in FRA in your flying history. I got the entire program, including being chided for indecipherable English accent! So I grew broadly immune towards yelling but unarmed agents .
I experienced two - one was really bad bird strike with one engine dead and a hole in the cocpit windscreen - saved our lives. The other one was rather unfortunate. In a bid to catch up with schedule and due to favourable winds, less fuel was taken to make the aircraft lighter. Unfortunately, winds changed half way through and we had to do emergency refueling in IST and came to VIE even later than we would should they take full amount of fuel. I still did not complain, because they were doing their best to get us all to VIE with minimum delay. It id not work in the end, but the emergency landing could potentialy save our lives, should pilot risked it and did not have enough emergency fuel before reaching VIE
Yeah  but the Poms just love to wallow in the silly smalltalk. Trying to find sense in that is a venture into deep cryptography. Even in Australia - where I learned English - some braindead smalltalk rituals have survived into modern day, terse, and to-the-point Strine.  But I truly do not see why one should not give a rude response to these time wasters. After all Bavarians too know to answer a "how are you today" with the equivalent of "why do you need to know that?".  So I generally take deep pleasure of murdering a conversation which contains such singularities as " if you know what I mean". A friendly "did you forget how to express youself in your own mother tongue" or "why don't you just say what you mean, so you save me the guesswork!" are considered rude but at least they fuel my entertainment and prevent the other party from being overly lazy with the phrasing bit. That may well be. I never lived in Germany and hence my confrontations are brief and usually painless as I much prefer a terse and hasty agent of a sloth who wastes my time.  This is why I am actually willing to believe that the OP's clash was culturally induced (not by language though). If one is really late and still let on a plane, then causing any further delay is very rude in my view of things. The agent may very well have been disappointed and offended by the OP's reaction.  I think this as if it was just an ill mooded agent then they would not have made the effort to get the OP plus heir on that flight.
thanks to those who gave some insightful replies (I am going to ignore the others). I do not think that cultural differences would have contributed to the "misunderstanding", I have lived in three continents so I am used to understanding the difference between, say, a straight forward, matter-of-fact Finnish comment vs. a rude remark. Also spent 7 years in Switzerland (not Germany, but in Basel I had more German colleagues than Swiss, so I am quite familiar with the "straight forward" feedback from German bosses ).  Despite not remembering the exact words, I can say for sure the behavior and tone were not appropriate (and even more so as the guy knew he was also waiting for two more pax), so the only advice I was really looking for was whether to write a letter or not. I think I will. .
Despite not remembering the exact words, I can say for sure the behavior and tone were not appropriate (and even more so as the guy knew he was also waiting for two more pax), so the only advice I was really looking for was whether to write a letter or not. I think I will. .  This story becomes more and more dubious. So in 7 years of spending in Switzerland, you didn't learn enough German to answer this guy straight to address you in ways that one should expect for a customer service situation? What did you do? You just walked away?  as I said already, I don't recall the exact words. therefore I am not going to comment on speculations about the possible German translation of an English sentence I don't exactly remember.  tone, posture, attitude and content of the remark were, in my opinion, unacceptable. I believe even in a German cultural context they were meant to be rude. in addition, Lufthansa is an international airline, they happily cash my American dollars, so the fact that the gate agent was German is irrelevant to me.  I do not believe that writing a letter to the customer service is, as a general rule, a waste of time. Hopefully if many customers complain about the quality of a specific aspect of a company's service, management will take action to improve, that's all I am after (pretty straight forward). I am not after compensation, as I had no damage (not even a bruised ego, as many people seem to imply )  Are you at all aware that you (I know there were two others as well) were holding up a bus of about 50 passengers? Others being even later doesn't mean that the others weren't inconvenienced by you as well. These 50 passengers were probably waiting in a cold bus (doors open to let you in).  So because Lufthansa is an international airline, every employee has to be perfect in English because they took your American dollars? I think you stated you flew on United so I assume United took care of cashing your American dollars, not Lufthansa. Next time I buy a ticket on Lufthansa (German carrier) and I have an onward connection on UA, YOU better make sure all the United employees speak perfect German with me (I am happy if they can manage to speak English properly).
Walk outside? One meter from the heated FRA gate under cover into the heated bus. And the excersise could have been done on that bus. Parents sometimes have a tendency to exaggerate
I remember my days as a young student in the UK. Being asked, "did you have a good day" my plain answer was "yes". The minimum expected would have been "yes, I had" or "yes, I had but it was better yesterday" or "yes I had, but it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain" or even "yes, I had but it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain but we can expect that the sun will be shining tomorrow." or "yes, I had bit it was better yesterday because we did not have so much rain but we can expect that the sun will be shining tomorrow - but how was yours."  Most Germans will culturally not do it that way and they will certainly not do it that way when using a foreign language.  I believe the story of the OP (if we forget about the second half with "go without your jacket") is a perfect example. "Beeilen Sie sich, Sie sind spÃ¤t dran" would not be anyhow offensive in Germany language (Flysurfer can certainly properly put this into the idom of the northern alps). However "hurry up, you are late" is understood as being rude.  Just think about this v/v, The UA Captain introducing himself with "Listen folks, I am John Doe and I will fly you guys into Frankfurt today". Translated literally into German "HerhÃ¶ren Leute, ich bin John Doe und ich werde euch Typen heute nach Frankfurt fliegen". Languagewise this translation would be correct. In the US, John Doe's announcement would not be surprising, however, if John Doe was transferred to LH and - after learning his poor German at high school for two years - tries to express himself with that statement, most people without a good command of English would somehow be - at least - surprised.  Being born in then Czechoslovakia, forced to learn Russian, later learning German and even later starting to learn English and then in 1992 moving permanently to Australia, I can wholeheartedly suuport all that you have said plus that I think it is also dependent on how/when/where one learns the other language. I have been using English 24/7 for the past 17+ years and still will never ever use it properly. My colleagues quite regularly remind me, that although something I have just said might be gramatically perfectly correct, they do not exactly 'like' it because they would say so differently. An example would be how I use word please. I was always thought by my English teachers (few of them native from UK) that I say "Please, do this and this". However, here in Australia many do not like the comma after please because according to them, by putting the comma after the word, one puts too much stress on it, basically changing the sentence from polite request to polite order Just recently, I have decided to revive my German. Surprise, surprise, I found that if I try to say something in German while thinking in English, I will say it in German differently than if I started from thinking in my mother tongue, Czech. Got it?
From my experiences at FRA that is probably about as friendly as it gets.
The language barrier some are using as a excuse is false.  I's not so much what was said it's the way it is said. I'm more likely to respond to a friendly smiling face telling me to get my backside into gear than some sour faced jobsworth asking me to hurry up. If they can't issue a instruction in a customer friendly way they shouldn't be in the job.
On your first question, cutting it fine, but possible, unless fog delays cascade and in turn, your incoming flight is delayed. On your second question, leave it to someone else more familiar than myself about LKO, to answer.
On the general subject relating to the original post, I think two rules should be kept in mind when considering complaining about airline service:  1. How was I feeling when the event occured? Negativity and stress cloud perception, just gotta be aware of it.  2. If I was treated this way as a customer of any other business (bookstore, TGV, hotel), would that treatment be acceptable?  No answer for the original poster, just general thoughts.
After landing in TLV, I waited the SN plane to clear. While doing so, I've noticed the ads that the screens showed.  Besides flying with SN to various destinations, checking in online, etc., they invited me and the other pax on board to use privilege. The flight was on mid-January.  I found it funny, and tried to explain the matter to the FAs, but they seemed to misunderstand me. They kept on explaining me that M&amp;M is SN's official FF program. So - if you're SN insider - make sure you updated all the ads to join Privilege with the ads of M&amp;M.  (yeah, I know this is not a real issue as the website will re-direct you to the right place, but I mean, it's at least three months after the merge, they should have stopped promoting Privilege long time ago).
agree, and I have absolutely no issue with people disagreeing with me on this forum.  airline agent: he can disagree on my view that a jacket is needed to go outside, no issue, but he should also be smart enough to know that (a) I decide in that situation, so the likelihood of me actually listening to him in that case is 0 and (b) I am the customer, so he shouldn't be rude
anyone have success writing a letter to the mint say why you need more quantities?
Yes.. I recemved the yellow/blank wrapper for the 2001 coins.
Mine were in yellow as well.
KA  HKG-PEK, C, one way  40000BA Miles! plus $ 25.46
by now banks/retailers probably hate the coins. it was fun last year when they had no idea about them.
I can't find any response to this post. Is anyone else getting the yellow/black 2001's? I just got 2 boxes of them. I find it hard to believe the mint would ship their $35.95 Sacagawea's instead of the $25 circulated rolls. Probably just changed the wrapping on some but before I circulate them I'd like to find out. Anyone know for sure about these?
I also got the yellow/black wrappers. My guess is that these were actually wrapped back in 2001 and the mint did not 'invent' the white/blue/red wrappers for the direct ship program yet. I suspect that the mint decided that they have too many of these coins in stock and they are not selling well at the premium price.  I'm not sure there is really any difference in the coins, with the exception that you might be able to get someone to pay more than face value if they are a collector and feel these are worth more to them.
no. they ask for support for claims.
Just want to add my thanks to bluethunder for organizing another seat sale. I realize it doesn't start until 9 a.m. but would it help to get there early to get a remaining Signature seat? I'm not going to camp out overnight, but I'm thinking 8 a.m.?
The counting machine aren't perfect. It just means they counted one of the coins as a quarter.
of the 5 boxes I got, 1 came with yellow wrappers  so how do I go about getting $35 bux for a $25 roll?
RJ  JFK-AMM, Y, one way  40000BA Miles plus $ 114.50
Wirelessly posted (BlackBerry8830/4.2.2 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1 VendorID/105)  This creates a little problem for you, since your order will no longer get free next day air shipping (free on orders over $300). Now they're going to send it via fedex/usps and you won't be able to track its progress well. Should always order at least a pair of whatever type.
Great new use for coins.  Girl Scout Cookies Not only don't they take credit cards - but you should have seen her little face when I just handed her the coins.
Why didnÂ?t you provide the necessary support?
Do you know what the qualification criteria / benefits were? Would be interesting to know as Andrew mentioned that AC was evaluating the possibility of introducing a lifetine status again.
Yes, I have the same problem. I buy several latitute passes each year and the exit rows remain blocked out during the seat selection when booking on a pass. This is not the case with a normal booking. There are other discrepancies as well. I fly out of Lethbridge on an almost weekly basis so I am always connecting in Calgary. Some of the YQL - YYC flights are operated under contract by CMA for Jazz, some by Jazz itself. When I book with my flight passes, I can select the seats on the CMA-operated flights, but if I book a separate ticket (ie not on a pass), I cannot select the seats on the CMA planes. I have to phone every time. I've been using the passes since they came out and it has always been this way. I find it hard to believe that this is that difficult to fix. Same goes with the preferred seating if on a pass. You have to log in to use the pass so the system knows that you are SE or E so the preferred seating should show up.
Thanks for your help Mikey!
I would have thought New York next?  They are the only one to operate ZRH - SIN directly, so they are more or less exclusive on this route. Moreover a lot of pax prefers ZRH as a stopover than FRA, MUC or LHR. If they had two 77W daily loaded at 70%, better to send one A380, than two not full planes I guess.
heading to the lovely Sheraton Cavalier in Calgary in the morningwon't get to enjoy my bed for a week, then off to the Marriott in Victoria. Can't complain though - haven't been on the road in a couple of weekskinda miss it now that I think about it!
At the Granbell in Shibuya - my new favourite hotel here in Tokyo. Walked forever today, but found a great Japanese Tex-Mex restaurant in Ebisu last night, so it was good to clear the hangover!
Has anyone tried to change there flight for free when its changed from a 1900D to a J32?  No one over 5ft should be allowed on a J32!
i do YYZ-YUL and i cant sleep too too much caffine and too excited to be away from my wife hahahahaa no need to do housework, so i spend all my time working overnight on projects
You must contact AC/AE directly to request this information. They keep all activity but break it down into AC-only actual flight miles, AC-only COS and other bonuses, other airline partner miles (including COS), other partner miles and in those cases of us old-timers, your CP earnings too.  Note that some US carriers, like AA, accept all miles earned from any source towards their lifetime Gold (1 million) and Platinum (2 million) and not sure what for ExecPlat. UA only accepts UA flight miles, as did AC when it offered lifetime. I personally only consider actual flown miles and COS as a legit measurehotels, car rentals, credit card points and other such earnings just don't cut it in the real world!
The plane proceeded to GVA. Not sure, if GVA sees service by the big bird anytime soon.  Link (in German)    I believe GVA is because the A380's two private customers required it.
I'll see yours and raise you a YYZ-LGA/JFK-FRA-BKK-PVG-ZRH-BOS amtrak JFK-LAX-ORD-YYZ followed by a BUF-IAD-LAX amtrak SAN-ORD-YYZ, all flights in their respective front cabins. I think our paths cross next week in PVG! At the moment in the Grand Club lounge at the Hyatt in Bangkok. Almost time for hors d'oeuvres and drinks!
I booked AKL-ROT in April recently and noticed the Jetstream on this route. My last trip on a Friday night from BHE to AKL left me unable to feel my legs for the best part of a week! They are starting to look very untidy as well, how long are we going to have to endure these things for
It's 0500 on Sunday and I'm at the Delta Bow Valley in Calgary. Still on London time. Was at Le Meridien Brussels last Tuesday on business Flying out to HNL today and will be at Hawaii Prince Hotel thereafter for a week.
I searched the preferred seating thread to no avail, apologies if my search skills missed something, but..  Is anybody else having difficulties selecting preferred seats on a latitude pass?
You can, however, spend up to 23 hrs and 59 minutes, if you can find a schedule that works. Better than nothing, I guess
No.   Effective May 2009, only stopover allowed is the gateway at North America when an award includes North America.
If I use my AA miles on a partner award from HKG-SYD/MEL, is a stopover in BKK/SIN allowed?
OK - now that does make sense to me Thanks for the clarity stiwi. AG.
The tests will be held at the Shriner's Club, next to A La Carte Event Pavilion on Dana Shore Drive in Tampa. Each test usually takes about two hours. During these sessions, participants will taste about four to five items and share their opinions.  Best wishes to residents and visitors to Tampa!
If sleeping is your primary concern, take a window. If you're concerned about being able to walk around without disturbing someone else, take an aisle.  You decide - it's your flight.

I'm in a hotel room too - sort of.  Spent New Years in Hong Kong (love Aeroplan points!), then a couple of weeks visiting family in Western Australia. The last week was too hot at 48C each day so I packed up 1 nephew and 2 nieces and we flew up to Bali, Indonesia where I am now. They are off buying some last minute ripoff DVD's and I just rang the butler and he is bringing some snacks and fresh squeezed juices.  Ahhhh the ocean breeze and the moist air - love it!! !
Would you recommend choosing a redemption on SQ's 744 from SIN-FRA or would you say TG's long-haul F service is better?  How do the two compare for 1. Lounge quality (accessible for SIN/BKK for F redemption tickets) 2. Drinks selection onboard 3. Food quality 4. Amenity kit quality 5. Seat quality 6. Entertainment quality
Where were you searching? A search of this forum using {"777" seat} threw up the consolidated thread and many others right away
hi I am a new member of Aeroplan. I would like to know how much does the miles cost in case I need some more miles for my award flight? How many miles can I buy on Aeroplan? Thank you for your answers
Monday-Friday I was in a 6$ a night guesthouse in Phnom Penh.  I was in the W Hong Kong on Friday, and I'm now sending this message from the Westin Nagoya, with a very beautiful view of Nagoya Castle from my window.  Back home to Seoul tomorrow.
Me, I'm out in Tokyo this week. It's 6:30 PM and I'm trying to stay awake long enough for dinner!
I'm on AA136 in early March, LAX to LHR. J-Class ticket. I chose 9J, since all the B and H seats (except first and last row) are taken.  Questions: 1) Should I take a D/G seat over a window (A/J) seat? 2) Is 9B bad? (SeatGuru and SeatExpert say stay away) 3) Same with 13B and 13H. SeatGuru/Expert say to stay away)  I prefer an aisle, so I can get up when I please. But maybe the window will be quieter / darker for sleeping? Thoughts?  (And yes, I did a search!!)  Thank you!
yep the ability to lie flat in economy is going to be great If you book the extra seats.. The biggest change will be to Pacific premium too as this is the largest growth sector. Expect to see some interesting 'angles' there.
Posting this from the Westin Kaanapaili Ocean Villas in Maui, not doing too bad with the time change, kids actually made it to 8:30 or so (11:30 Calgary time) which is late for them and like HerpaYVR I don't miss the weather, work or time zone!
Hi,  First post in this forum,  Been trying to view / book an LHR-PVG-LHR award flight for end of this year, .. website has said for a day or two it has technical difficulties and can't propose a schedule, yet it will happily propose one for just about any other route from LHR to asia.  Curious as to whether this is an intermittent glitch - or it's a route not offered online for some reason? ..  Anyone know what flies the route? I was informed that Air China codeshares with VS, .. but suspect my chances of getting on a VS flight using aeroplan miles are .. somewhat slim?
and many others right away  Thanks for the reply. Clearly your search skills are better than mine. That link didn't come up in my search results, so thanks, search expert!!
Maybe you could tell us!
Hampton Inn Coconut Grove (MIA). Very quiet corner room, but a very restless night nonetheless. I fear my post-dinner decaffeinated espresso wasn't. --
You can purchase up to 50% of the total mileage required for the ticket you wish to obtain.
Correct  3 cents a mile -- plus you have to add GST
If you are booking an on-line AE flight reward and you do not have adequate mileage in your account for the ticket you wish to purchase, the website will tell you how much you have to pay to "buy out" your mileage deficiency. It is typically about three cents per mile.
oh dear god, 12:20am and todays grab a seats have not loaded - they are always up by 12:05 - whats going on
That price is ex-ZRH, which is always expensive place to start your journey from.  In order to get cheaper price you have to start your journey in places like LHR or MAN, where the price is 1/3 of what you mentioned: about GBP 1900.
If you have to fly the Jetstream sit in one of the seats by themselves, then your legs can at least spill out the side. It was uncomfortable but survivable for TRG-AKL (I'm 6'4") but anything longer than that would've been hell.
Ramada outside of Pittsburg.
Yes I did. Backpacks now seem OK as carry ons.
As long as people are willing to go on them, I'd stay there here to stay or untill Eagle drops some routes.
I had to call in. SE on a T+ pass so should have been able to book them. I think it is an extension of the problem where you can't upgrade in advance using a cert when using a pass credit; there seems to be certain IT limits with the passes.
Yes it is considered a co-terminal, but if you arrive at ITM and depart from KIX or vice versa, you still use up a coupon for the segment between them.  Co-terminals are mainly relevant for purposes of stopovers.

Are H and J connected like D and E?  The arrival and departure screens show the LAN flights departing from J gates. Plus when ever I go through MIA I see the various LAN airlines at J gates. That said MIA gates are common use so there could be times when a LAN flight will depart H.    I think the ticket counter is infront if the H concourse. And I do not know of H and J are connected airside.  EDIT: It looks like G/H/J are all connected airside.
But, I did find this bit interesting:    Basically, DL is still attempting to remove Hawaii from the equation. Previous versions of this argument suggested that since the majority of Japan - Hawaii passengers are not American, it's fundamentally different than other US - Asia markets.  However, I don't believe the DOT cares about passengers' nationalities. What's more, you can bet that AA's lawyers won't allow any Hawaii parsing.  It is not about nationality. The reference to Beach Markets is just saying that the traffic is basically 100 percent leisure or in some ways akin to a charter market, so needs to be looked at in a separate light. DL is simply trying to draw the lines on the field that will best suit JL/DL ATI while AA is doing the reverse.  If JL/DL have to make separate concessions on the Beach Markets they will probably be more than happy. Obviously the JL/DL play is to show that they are not overly dominant in major O&amp;D markets such as NRT-LAX/SFO/ORD/NYC. It will be interesting to see how JL/DL stacks up in those markets vs. the other ATI benchmark of AA/BA on LHR-LAX/SFO/ORD/NYC.
LX or SQ all the way!
Just transited through DPS a couple of weeks ago on a very tight schedule. Following 'transfer' signs fruitless--doors locked, and desk unmanned--and signs suggested it was only valid for Garuda passengers anyway.  But the immigration situation moves fast--you pay $10 for 7-days-or-less visa (this involves paying cash at one desk, then standing in line to get the visa added to your passport, then stamped). Then you have to walk over to the departures terminal, check back in (if you don't have your BPs), and go pay your 150,000Rp exit tax (or $19). Voila. The whole thing took less than 45 minutes, maybe only 35--though it prob helped that we were in biz class and got off the plane sooner.  Teensy hurdle is that you have to go through security at departure _before_ check-in desks, and they ask to see your tickets (how quaint!). We didn't have anything printed out, even, but I was able to fish out some random paper I'd written our itinerary on. Second time we left DPS, we didn't even have this, so a small bit of back-and-forth with security guy, but he waved us on.  I suspect the transfer doors are _always_ shut. It's more profitable for them to funnel you through immigration!
There is a code in the blog until 7pm PST begins THANKSAGAIN
I have had that too. I think that it's a temp. glitch in the system. Have entered several times before with the same problem and then suddenly it would work.  Fear not fellow FTer!
Also--the more I think about it, even though I clearly understand the answer, it appears that if you come in on an AA flight and need to change to almost any other airline in MIA you have to exit and re-clear. That just doesn't make sense. I guess I am spoiled using DFW so much.  LAN - and all of AA's partners - will share gates with AA starting next year. LAN is in Concourse J only temporarily because of closed gates.
BKKROP, I do know that when you gain, and especially maintain, Gold then you get the 5000 miles bonus.  You are right, that too is handyand amounts to a USD $150 (in terms of buying those miles).
I really enjoy the Dom and look forward to it when flying TG F. Will the absence of Dom actually make me re-think booking TG F (paid or redemption) in favour of another carrier though No, it won't
So I'm still on the waitlist for a J upgrade from ORD to PVG on 1/25. However, expertflyer shows there's 1 C seat available. What does that mean? Why is it still available if there are people on the waitlist?
Still holding at F4 J5 for now.  Arrrgh!  J  I don't see how this is inconsistent w/the scenario outlined by CO FF. Nowhere does s/he say that you can jump the line by simply upgrading someone else and taking their seats.
The following article is basically a rehash of the other 1/21 articles:    But, I did find this bit interesting:  Basically, DL is still attempting to remove Hawaii from the equation. Previous versions of this argument suggested that since the majority of Japan - Hawaii passengers are not American, it's fundamentally different than other US - Asia markets.

In the spa you just get the one - they stamped my boarding pass with a 'thai spa' stamp when I made the booking.  There are however other places where massage is available - I think it is THB500 for 45 mins.  In the lounge the masseurs are variable. I had two neck and shoulders - one on the way out, one on the way back. The first one was very forgettable - more like a mosquito soft landing on my shoulders.  The second one was much better by comparison, but only once or twice did she kind of hit a knot with even part of the strength required to get into it.  The foot massages looked good (there was a fellow getting one done in front of me).  So maybe take the foot massage in the lounge and go for a paid neck and shoulders and, if you want it, ask for a strong masseur.  The 30 mins timing is also quite flexible (to put it nicely). By the time they take you in, fluff around, go off to get a hot towel just before it finishes, and then give you time to put your shoes on at the end you have about 20 mins of actual massage time all up.  Still a nice way to fill in time though
Sometimes I have to put my AAdvantage number in all caps and it will recognize it not exactly sure why this happens though
thankspenny  You just need to put your "SEA:: DL DL DL DL" codes in the "To" and "From" boxes. It kind of threw me at first also, as it is not intuitive, and is too simple
I've been a 1K for 3 years and all on my own dime.  I do not do pure mileage runs, rather I do weekend runs to someplace; ie LHR for the President's Day Do. It is worth to me because I like travelling and do very little else. You at least have to stay.  If it is a really good promo, then do the MRs. I got 3 weeks in business class South America due to AA promotions. My outlay on the promos was much less than my fare just to IPC.  This year could well be different since my son's tuition is kicking in.
Look here: Mileage Runs turnarounds / turnabouts / transits:- Experiences please Kiwiflyer updates the index (post 257) from time to time
That's impressive! If you follow the thread the jig is up seems you are the rarity, looks like the AA churn is over except for a few that get through. YMMV?  I'm going to try the churn in a couple months, maybe the key is waiting for the offers like you mentioned you received, though after the change with Citi's terms I doubt they are going to be sending those offers out.
BEST ADVICE EVER!! I called 10 mins ago and just asked about the upgrade list. They said to just wait, I'm still on the waitlist. After reading HNL and your post, I called back immediately and the confirmed the SWU on the spot.  What's the point of a waitlist then if they don't confirm you when a C seat opens up?
What does that mean? Why is it still available if there are people on the waitlist?  And don't ask for explanations, analyze it or even post about it.
Going to fly from Tokyo to central Europe using my miles / business class next month.  Which airline do you prefer, NH, LH, LX, OS?  Thanks  Have you done a search? There are many thread about this topic. Also don't forget SQ, OZ, TG, CA which can also get you there with one stop possibly.
At one stage the TG account fell below whatever silver is and on the next flight, I became silver and 3000 was put into the account. Then, when gold was achieved they lobbed in another 5000. What I was chuffed about, when I retained gold they added another 5000. The next flight was to HKG. I got 10000 for the that flight to HKG, then all these unexpected bonuses. If you had the time and the energy to work all these programs out, to maximise every last mile, you would do alright. Wonder if anyone has, or are you just like me and pick up a little along the way and don't know about it until the statement arrives
Try to clear the cache (memory) on your computer.
thanks for fast response. using the same scenario, could I get a gold upgrade for the return leg say a week after departure?
Hope it will be operational by October this year!
What about ITM?
First, thanks for your posts.  benzguy80: thanks, I am just starting with all this new world. How many days would you think may be necesary to get good MR? How many days should I start thinking about for the next time? Thanks again.  WrLdTrvLnIndian: I am new on this, so thats the way I am asking. I made all my effort before, at the AA.com website, searching many many times diff options etc. Do you have any suggestion on how to look for fares or opportunities by my self? thanks.
Forgive me if this was asked/answered, but where do you stay at night? Do you just sleep at the airport and occasionally at your friends' houses? Obviously staying at a hotel would somewhat hurt your cent/mile ratio but I wouldn't blame you if you did
On the AA MIA terminal map it says LAN uses the J gates. ON the MIA airport website it says the H gates. This is where my original confusion came from.  Also--the more I think about it, even though I clearly understand the answer, it appears that if you come in on an AA flight and need to change to almost any other airline in MIA you have to exit and re-clear. That just doesn't make sense. I guess I am spoiled using DFW so much.
Do try again, please. Here's the industry "scorecard", courtesy of Gizmodo:   Who is "All the rest", and what is "majority"? Airtran and Virgin America, yes, 100% coverage. Bra-vo, as they say. Delta, yes, just about all the pre-merger planes have it, thanks to the prod from Airtran, but that leaves all the NW planes to consider. The rest of the carriers are a disgrace compared to AA. United, 13 planes, or about 3% of the mainline fleet. Southwest, a handful of planes, about 1% of the fleet. US Airways, announced for 50 A321's, vaporware not yet delivered. CO, announced for 21 757's, vaporware not yet delivered.
Why City Air Terminii are so popular is that the vast number of tourist have no hotel loyalty programs, so are booted out into the streets at 10am, and their flight back home leave at midnight. 85% of tourist relate taxi as expensive and given a choice will catch a train/bus. As to your comment about the connection between the different modes of transport, you may be right, I am only retelling a description from a proud young Thai man. Personally I believe it will be hugely popular. I catch the airport express in HKG and Sin regularly, Singapore is no hassle even though you do change trains and in HKG I catch a taxi to the hotel from Central. Frequent travellers are also able to incorporate these fares into credit cards, octopus and the likes.
with 2 passengers its not much different in price to get a taxi to the airport than getting this BKK train. I will stick to door to door taxi's in Bangkok when going to and from the airport. The price is very low for taxi's in Bangkok.  That's the difference in HK and SIN, where a taxi cost far more money in comparison. Plus, the HK and SIN train systems are far more extensive than Bangkok's, even when the airport link is opened.
What does that mean? Why is it still available if there are people on the waitlist?  call now.
What's the point of a waitlist then if they don't confirm you when a C seat opens up?  As I said (and perhaps you misunderstood):  Just enjoy it.  And credit the "BEST ADVICE EVER" to HNL and GadgetFreak, rather than me.
I use AA.com for the simple stuff, sometimes go trolling with ITA Matrix because it allow searching (Month-long) for same-day turns. ITA generously provides access for free, just sign up and get a login and password.   Hi Benzguy80,  Like the OP I am currently working on an AA Challenge. The ITA Matrix is very cool, and I am sure will be very helpful to me in finding MRs.  Thanks so much!
Hi, Going to fly from Tokyo to central Europe using my miles / business class next month.  Which airline do you prefer, NH, LH, LX, OS?
VIE-DXB has been operated by B763 equipment for some time now.  OS Press Release - EVEN STRONGER PRODUCT TO DUBAI USING BOEING 767: AUSTRIAN EXPANDS CAPACITY FROM MARCH 2009  B763 has tilt bed seats in Business Class, around 60" pitch.
FYI   (some pics of the city line train and the terminals)   (video of the express train)
The transit through YYZ is generally fairly painless, just ensure you allow a reasonable connection time for the return transit as that will take longer (you have to pick up your bags from the transit luggage carousel, and take them through to US-bound security, then pre-clear US customs. The baggage handlers can be pretty slow, so this whole process (including clearing security) can easily take an hour. On the plus side, it speeds up getting off the plane in ORD - and since you had to connect somewhere, you might as well achieve something during the transit!  The outbound transit is fine - duck straight through the specified channel as mentioned above. US airports could learn a lot from this. Oh, and the AVOD on AC is pretty good - lots of choices, and they even have it on their shorthaul planes for the transborder flights too (provided you're not stuck on a CRJ). You do still get free booze and food on AC transatlantic too, unlike the US carriers.
An Expertflyer.com subscription with Flight Alert will check constantly for you and send you an email/SMS when the availability opens.
H and J are now connected behind security. The LAN, Club America lounge is landside, on the 4th floor of the J Terminal. Nice lounge, but landside nonetheless. By virtue of your J class ticket, you'll have access the the elite line. Security clearance in H/J, especially with elite line access, has, in my experience, not been much of an issue. Bon voyage.
Must of just expired, I missed it!! Thanks anyway.
Flying the 87 LHR-ORD next friday and i really doubt there is any chance of my Y-J upgrade clearning.  I requested about a month ago, it went from being half empty to nearly full. Grrrrr.  Thankfully my two redeyes returning cleared which is good i guess.
The password, however, is case sensitive.
What mistake, exactly? American is ahead of other airlines in this aspect.  First, American was the first airline to deploy Gogo in-flight internet (see a comprehensive review of the service ).  Right now a total of 700 aircraft across various airlines (Air Canada, Delta, United Airlines, among others) have Gogo deployed. Once the Gogo deployment of the 737 fleet has been completed and more Super 80s have been added, AA will have 320 aircraft with Gogo. This will probably give American the largest Internet-enabled fleet at that point.
After all the walking I've done here in Bangkok over the past several days I certainly am looking forward to a foot massage tomorrow morning before heading to PVGand if time, may a neck and shoulder one too!
Well - you can all rest easy if I'm on one of your flights - I don't like DOM!
Hi, dazz81 is right about the opening, although some pundits are saying August. The Makkasan City Air Terminal is however no joke, it's an brilliant piece of urban engineering, and will not be dissimilar to Singapore, KL and Hong Kong. If you are familar with Bangkok the terminus will be close to the land mark you are able to see from Siam, a tall thin building with advertising on it's side called Baiyoke Tower, so it will only be a quick taxi from any of the major chain hotels. In course of time the terminus will link up with the underground and the skytrain. In Thailand things are slower than Singapore's pace, but let me tell you, in MEL we have been talking about an airport link for years, and we are still talking.  The terminus will operate the same as Hong Kong, elimiating the need to lug your baggage all the way to BKK. You will love it, if coming to Thailand later this year, I should imagine it will be up and running.
I am curious about this as I heard that one will have to walk across a busy intersection and then some to access the SkyTrain and/or the Metro.  Hope they've figured a way around this--always thought that sounded dreadful. I can't imagine tourists having to lug heavy suitcases across traffic to continue their journey. Probably easier, at that point, to just cab it directly to the airport.  Then again, it sounded that the point of the train was mostly for light/business travelers--so perhaps that's not a bad thing for those of us traveling lightly.
Bingo.
EWR-DXB in F on UA and get in a few hours earlier."  Why travel from X (NY?) to DC then take a train back to NY/NJ, in order to fly EWR/IAD to catch the non-stop UA IAD/DXB?  It was a typo. I assume he meant sales calls in DC and then IAD-DXB on UA.
Wouldn't know, dazz81, been drinking Krug lately
Stars alliance RWT passengers are permitted with 2 of 23kgs checked baggages free of charge on the entire trip &amp; no charge on change of travel date (not rerouting), but U.S. airways &amp; Continential Airline new rule on checked baggage fee do not mention any exemption on RWT.  Can anyone explain, please? SOS Thank you  Seems self-explanatory. RTW trumps other regs in my experience.
I support your opinion - list of *A served international airports with *G lounge is at lounges.1.html. Being *A website for their own staff, it should be ultimate reference
Mrs bj2757 received another offer for the Citi MasterCard today with 25,000 miles (plus 5000 to sign someone else up, and another 5000 if you pay the annual fee in a year - har har). I signed her up - no decision yet.
Yes you're spoiled. There are lots and lots of airports, mostly built when flying was principally point-to-point rather than hub-and-spoke, where one must reclear security to transfer from one airline to another.
Mon 2/15 is a holiday, thus IMO Sun afternoon flights could actually be easier than that Monday
I believe you can do something like this, to specify 2 or more segments(but I am rusty) SEA:: DL+ DL+ MIA:: DL+ DL+  SEA:: DL DL+ MIA:: DL DL+ saves a few characters and also works I agree its best not to immediately try to do 4 segments each way- I generally start with 2+ forced through a hub that will give more miles, and then constrain it more to get more interesting routings
I wish it was on tap in my kitchen AG.

SEA :: DL+ MIA :: DL+  would show you lots of all Delta routes with one or more segments.  perhaps i'm looking in the wrong place, yet i see nothing on the ITA site that allows me to input something such as the "DL" x 4 stringor find a link on the site to anything called "airline-plus". can you possibly provide a link or maybe some baby steps for finding out how to use this tool successfully?  never mindthe clever boyfriend figured it out!
Yes, if it is an upgrade seat available call immediately.
My next flight on AA is in about 2 weeks' time and I requested to be waitlist for SWU upgrade just before the new year.  Looking at the seat map on aa.com, it looks like 15 out of the 30 seats in the 763 are occupied. Do you think it is worth phoning the EXP desk? Is there any point phoning given I am already on the waitlist?  Should I still hold hopes or should I wait until I am at the airport?
Web services can reset your password and that number is toll free. I don't know why you would have to call a "paid one" unless you are calling from outside the US.
Hi there  I have a USD600 AC voucher and a USD800 UA voucher to use. Am based in the UK, so the plan is to go somewhere interesting combining these two vouchers (I think south America).  So, I can see that the best use of the AC voucher is UK-USA, and the UA voucher is USA-Rio I think (Buenos Aires seems more expensive).  The question is -- which US city is the best to transit through? I could go UK-LAX cheaply on AC, but then LAX-RIO is expensive on UA. Or UK-ORD on AC, and then ORD-RIO on UA, which works, but isn't necessarily the greatest number of miles accrued.  Anyone have any thoughts?  Thanks!  LHR*G
Yes, LH uses it, but not all *A Gold
Looking at the seat map on aa.com, it looks like 15 out of the 30 seats in the 763 are occupied. Do you think it is worth phoning the EXP desk? Is there any point phoning given I am already on the waitlist?  Should I still hold hopes or should I wait until I am at the airport?  AA is clearing upgrades closer to flight date than they did in the past. With the cabin half empty and only two weeks to go, your odds are excellent. I would not be concerned.
PRG does not have *A lounge.  List of *A destinations with *A Gold lounges is at lounges.1.html. I would then guess that all the other airports do not have *A lounge.
I emptied the mileage bank at Christmas by taking the whole family with me to Paris on award flights - ROP were very good about making 3 F award flights available on top of my using the GUP. We pretty well had the F section of the planes to ourselves between BKK &amp; CDG.  It's just the GUPs that might still be available.
Fear not fellow FTer!   Had the same thing happen to me about a month ago. Called AAdvantage and she said give it an hour or so and try to login again. It worked and havent had a problem since.
Would be great if they have male masseurs!
Another question,which website can we book mileage-fool routing ?
What's the point of a waitlist then if they don't confirm you when a C seat opens up?  Just enjoy it.  And credit the "BEST ADVICE EVER" to HNL and GadgetFreak, rather than me.   I dont know but I have seen it before more than once. You might have gotten it anyway, but ORD-PVG is not one to leave to chance.  Oh, and thanks vasantn
Yea conversation will go like following:  Girl: So, why are you in town for? Me: Nothing. Just to have dinner with you. Girl: Awww Tell me why are you really here. Me: Actually, I'm flying for the airline miles/status. Just an overnight. I'm flying home tomorrow. Girl: Are you crazy
Any firing or lay-offs I have been in with the private sector has nothing to do with union. It's all about cost-profit-benefit equation. Sometimes it does make sense to lay-off a more senior person if overall compensation is more than the overall payoff to the business, but that is the same equation that is used in any company that is making profit consistently - regardless of seniority.  Again, that's what is wrong with the airlines - they have no regard to performance, just seniority as it relates to staffing realignments.  Completely agree. First you get rid of the dead weight and less-than-outstanding employees that were hired/kept when ideal prospects were difficult to find (especially if better candidates are now available on the cheap). Then all things being equal (or near equal), one of the next considerations are those that are more senior/higher paid that are not performing better than junior/lower paid employees. Of course, these are often not the only factors.
Where is the tier calculator ?
AA's average hours flown per month is low mostly due to decisions that AA has made regarding how they want to operate their airline. They have a lot of different types of airplanes (MD80, B737, B757/767,B777) and a lot of crew domiciles (bases). That means they need a lot of reserve coverage in a lot of different places. AA also scheduled their airplanes to fly in/out of very large hubs and to provide comprehensive connection opportunities. This means that the airplanes spend more time on the ground at the hub, waiting for the passengers and bags to change flights, and more time on the ground at the outstations waiting for the right time to fly back into the hub at about the same time as all of the other airplanes. This means that each crew member has less efficient schedules and averages fewer flight hours per day worked.  SWA is the other extreme with their single aircraft type (for crew qualification purposes) and very short turn times allowing the SWA crew members to fly quite a bit more hours per day (on average) and allows them to operate with far fewer reserves.  AA understands all of these factors but believes that the benefits gained by the different types of aircraft and comprehensive connecting hubs outweigh the loss in productivity that results.  The employees ARE the union.  It's not practical. There are several thousand crew members and only a handful of chief pilots. They do their work literally all over the world so their work in not directly monitored by their supervisors. In fact, their supervisors may not even recognize them by name when they pass in the hall. It's also difficult to quantify the performance of the crew members as they each are presented with different scenarios and often the best course of action is not known. How do so few managers fairly evaluate and rate so many individuals? That's why seniority is used at almost all airlines of any size whether union or not. It just works better than the alternative.
I'm sure the folks expecting an upgrade to OGG got a nice surprise but not the folks looking to fly to LAX tomorrow AM!  I have been on a flight HNL-LAX that was changed from a 757 to a 762. You referred to a change from a 762 to a 757 as a "downgauge", but the 757 is really a larger plane. This seems to happen from time to time on the LAX-Hawaii routes.
The unions wanted seniority to prevent what goes on in IT and other industries: Layoffs based on salary not performance. (i.e. laying off high wage employees regardless of job performance to lower payroll) I understand the logic of seniority system since it prevents high wage personnel from getting the axe in layoffs. However, it does allow poor performing employees alot of cover and prevents management from getting rid of them. Also it can hurt good employees who have not been with the company for a long time as they are the first to go.  Yes it does suck. But the employees ASKED for this system when they formed thier unions. They really cant complain when it works against them.
Still confused!  I was already Silver going into 2009 calendar year, I have achieved 16,091 teir points during Jan 2009 and June 2009 (although my account only says 15,931) When I use the new tier calculator it says my rolling period is 1st Jan 2009 to 31st Jan 2010. To achieve gold I would need 34,069 TP`s which I understand, However to retain Silver I need 9,069 TP`s by my review date which it doesn`t say is when (I would assume Jan 31st also)  But, here`s the thing, it states my current status is Silver, I apparently achieved this on 1st March 2010 and I have 15,931 TP`s since my date of achievement, not sure how I have managed this as by my last calculation we are still in Jan 2010 or have I missed something?  The expiry date on my current card is March 2010, does that mean I have until march to retain silver?
Not likely to happen. "A" is a revenue bucket. "X" never was.
AA18 SFO-JFK redeye return in Jliterally have been up for 24 hours, and can't sleep =( GoGo Fact: "In 1973, AA became the first major airline to employ a female pilot when Bonnie Tiburzi was hired to fly Boeing 727s."
In this case the OP could also have pre purchased the excess allowance online at a discounted rate before the flight.  Anyway, according to the excess baggage calculator, the charge would have been USD 500 for every extra 10 kilos. Unless the luggage was also oversized, I don't see a bike weighing 40 kilos.
I am not sure if EK use it for excess fees, but using volumetric weight, bikes can be quite expensive beasts. Even so, the OP does not seem to dispute that he was over the weight limits but hadn't checked what the airlines fees were for excess

So if I see this correctly, AA EXP has to pay baggage fee on AS !?  1st Bag $15 (USD) one way 2nd Bag $25 (USD) one way 3rd Bag $50 (USD) one way  What about the fact that now from Canada to the US we can only take one carry on !?
I'd just call again.. I've definitely been able to do it on reservations on hold you just have to get the right agent Unfortunately, a few agents make up their own procedures for processing requests. I find that if I don't like one agent's response then I'll probably like another one's
Correct. I do it ALL THE TIME (at least a dozen times a year). Really.
Another story.  I was on a EWR-LHR VS flight a few years ago in Premium economy. The first officer announced that the captain was called Andy and I forgot the other names. The guy sat next to me explained that "Andy" was Andrea and was his wife and they were getting and R&amp;R in NYC.  A couple of hours into the flight she visited him from the flight deck (pretty good looking..), they explained a few pleasantaries and she left to go back to the desk.  The landing in LHR was flawless and is probably the smoothest landing of wide-body I've ever enountered. I mentioned this to his husband, at which point he commented "But she can't park for peanuts" ;-)
Please, let's not confuse the term "downgauge," referring to size with "downgrade," referring to quality.  Also not sure the degree to which a flight at 6am on a Sunday constitutes a "business" route.  It also seems more of a coincidence that a flight ex-JFK is cancelled as a result, rather than a flight ex-LAX. In theory, could utilize a 762 for the late OGG departure and redeye return without losing any JFK service. AA 117 theoretically could have been turned to head to OGG (117 arrived early, 161 departed late) still leaving ample aircraft for the two redeyes to JFK and returning to LAX early the following morning.
The $339 for gold looks like a great deal if you check two bags regularly. Two bags costs $120 per r/t these days so with just three trips it pays for itself.
An all female flight crew of a SeaKing Search / Rescue helicopter was on an RAF PR photo shoot when they got word of a RAF Jaguar aircraft in which crashed due to a bird strike, The single pilot ejected into the sea and his emergency beacon activated.  On being hoisted into the helicopter the pilot saw the loadmaster/hoist operator and swore "bloody hell a woman", the Pilot and Navigator then looked around, the pilot that shouted more "bloody women".  The loadmaster then firmly reminded him, that it was HE who crashed the jet and who was the better aircrew. lol
I've been an AAdvantage member since 1984 and been lurking here for probably at least 10 years. I remember reading in the Dallas Morning News about the first all female flight crew on a flight from OKC to DFW. If I recall correctly it was a 727 so that should tell you it has been some time ago! This probably happens more times than we know of but I for one have absolutley no problem with it.  Thanks to all for the informative posts over the years. I'm at 1.6 mm lifetime and looking for the 2mm mark for lifetime PLAT  Anyone remember triple miles back in the 80's
to recover the miles.
A mai tai means I'm on the way to HNL.  Oh yes - I am on AA 7 (DFW-OGG) on Tuesday  I'll be sure and have a Mai Tai for you
While at LAX today, I noticed that today's (1/23/10) LAX-OGG flight 161, was a 762. All Hawaii flights out of LAX are now 757s. I know equipment subs happen from time to time but it is also my understanding that there are no "extra" 767-200s to go around. If one of them goes mechanical, it results in a downgauge (to a 757), an upgauge to a 767-300 or a cancellation on one of the JFK-LAX/SFO/MIA runs. Doing a quick check of tomorrow's flights (1/24/10), 201 JFK-LAX is cancelled. Don't know the logic behind subbing a 767-200 for a leisure market resulting in a cancellation of a premium route like JFK-LAX.  I'm sure the folks expecting an upgrade to OGG got a nice surprise but not the folks looking to fly to LAX tomorrow AM!
I'm kind of new here, but it seems when I signed up it said something about your level expiring in the month following your birthday. If you didn't provide a birthdate then it would be January.
The AVL flights will be perfect for me, save hours of driving. Just checked for the dates I need in July, not loaded yet.
Hi all,  Me and my hubby are flying: 27april2010 136EK Venice-Dubai 3.35pm-23.30pm 04.may2010 135EK Duba-Venice 9.10am-14.00pm  We will be flying on a330-200 in business class, and the aircraft has 2 classes.  We picked 2row A and B seats. What do you think?  Thank you in advance for your reply
unfortunately, they would need at least one flight but still well worth it for some I would assume!  Ah, I missed that. Thanks for the correction!
Nope. She seemed to know the way to London quite well.
Sounds like you are talking about the executive management team
1st Bag $15 (USD) one way 2nd Bag $25 (USD) one way 3rd Bag $50 (USD) one way  What about the fact that now from Canada to the US we can only take one carry on !? Haven't kept up on our Brothers to the East but yes, you get to pay the lovely AS baggage fees still (nope, nothing has changed )  However AS does have a Baggage Service Guarantee  Get Your Bags in 25 Minutes Guaranteed  At Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, we extend our caring service to you and your belongings.

I think I've been on a couple SFO-DFW flights in which we went around the terminals a couple of times.  Imagine, if a pilot came on the radio, saying that the gate was occupied and he was going to wander and find one free
In all other cases though, yes you would be able to apply to a reservation on hold.  Why would they have to ticket it to apply the upgrades? I booked flights online, called to apply the upgrades, then had upgrades clear while the reservation was still on hold.

Welcome to FT!  On a stopover do a quick run to Doha or MCT but do so via Arabian Airpass if it you starting outside of Middle East. $35 each way in Y - and even if it is a Saver fare (which is unknow) it is still 1000 miles for the return trip. If you are over 1000 miles you need you can combine Y and J.
There's a train too. You have to go downtown to catch it I believe, but I wouldn't worry about this one if you can't change the ticket. If you miss connect there are lots of other flights. If you can't get there by plane there are lots of ground options.
Interesting thread I guess this post &lt;  &gt; is the winner, because it sheds light on the DXB-Attitude, as displayed by EK Management.  "The Girls" driving for 90+ hours / month is an issue, but unlike most mainline EU &amp; American carriers their firm and their jobs are secure.  I have yet to meet an EK employee who was happy with their job. Guess EK is the new Disney
I don't see any connection between a 762 flying LAX-OGG on Saturday afternoon and the cancellation of an early Sunday morning JFK-LAX flight. You're assuming that the plane grabbed for OGG was scheduled to fly from LAX to JFK on Saturday, but I don't see any LAX-JFK cancellations for Saturday, Jan 23.  Actually, there is plenty of slack in the 15 plane 762 fleet, which flies but 14 daily round-trip transcons and one daily JFK-MIA-JFK turn (plus the extra Saturday-only MIA turn when one JFK-LAX-JFK does not fly).  15 airplanes flying 28 5.5-6.5 hour flights and two 2 hour flights each day leaves plenty of extra slack for maintenance and substitutions.
While I'm sure there are similar reports on my experience below, I, like you, am still amazed at how uninformed the agents sometimes are (and even worse -- they insist their understanding of the rule is correct. At least they could admit they are not sure and go find out).  I called Aadvantage award bookings yesterday and told the representative that I would like to book a partner award to London in June. She said, there are no partner awards to London and was about to explain the non BA TATL awards rule. But I cut her off and asked her to check Iberia through Madrid, connecting to LHR. To her surprise, it showed up as eligible for a partner award -- amazing!  To end, I told her not to tell anyone else about this trick  no sense in draining award capacity due to informed reservation agents!  On that note  Award availability from AA from Europe is terrible right now. Hopefully my new BA 100k miles from Chase will save the day since BA at least seem like they are "allowing" TATL awards this summer, unlike AA.
Thanks for the heads up! I had given up getting my Fall trip as a First Class award. I called today and was able to get great options for F class awards LAX-BKK, returning MNL-LAX. Thank you! I love CX First. The best across the Pacific. Makes all those connections at DFW during the year worth it.
300 USD.
Interesting call from AA marketing this week, asking as an EXP how much would I pay to extend VIPs expiring in 2010 another year.  I told them maybe $99 at most, depending on if I needed to use them. Any thoughts
One of the last flights of the 763 on this route  Dinner Service  Warm Nuts  Mojito Shrimp served with somen noodles garnished with parsley  Standard Salad  Bread Basket  Choice of grilled chicken breast with basmati rice or the four cheese ravioli with tomato sauce  Ice Cream sundae (the real kind where they come around with the cart-sadly this will be disappearing soon the FAs say)  Cookies before landing
Same here. I wish I could get miles instead of SWU's each year.
I usually travel with my ENZO only  EK or for that sake even DHL or UPS are ok with it as long as they know SCHUMI is gona help me jump start it  Safe Flying  EGT  Presumably Ferraris are verboten now he is driving for Mercedes.
Thanks to all for the informative posts over the years. I'm at 1.6 mm lifetime and looking for the 2mm mark for lifetime PLAT  Anyone remember triple miles back in the 80's  Maybe I will meet you in TYR one day as I fly out, I am there or GRK weekly, rotate around based on length of trip. they really need to get a bar/food vendor there, the machines are non personable. the old restaurant was unique with that huge burger, in the old terminal I remember it as a child.   I landed just before 3 tornadoes earlier this week  Nice to have you here at FT. Welcome aboard!
If one AA pilot in every 200 is female, and one first officer in every 50, there will be an all-female cockpit on (on the average) one flight out of 10,000. If AA has about 1,000 flights per day, this will occur on the average once every ten days.  If 4 out of 5 FAs are female, there will be an all-female cabin crew about half the time on a 3-FA flight. The odds drop as the size of the cabin crew goes up, to 25 percent with six FAs, but remain substantial.  (I don't know if any of these is the exact number, but I suspect they're close. If you prefer different ones, use them.)  Put these together and you get a statistical expectation of an all-female crew about once a month. Since a crew stays together for more than one flight, there will tend to be a cluster followed by a dry spell, but that will be the long-term average.  If there are 150 pax on a typical flight, about 1,800 will fly with an all-female crew over the course of a statistically typical year. A tiny number compared to all the folks who fly AA in that time, but not as exclusive as a Nobel Prize either.
Well, if we're going to be THAT pedantic, going from J to F is an upgrade, no, since F is a higher service class, right? So people should be happy when their 762 J seat turns into 752 F. I can't imagine why this wouldn't be the case.
I wish I ever had that problem ! I always use mine well before the end of the calendar year and usually end up with the opposite problem, needing more (and using miles/copay) to tide me over
Edited to add: found them at BevMo, but at almost $3 each (w/tax) they're not cheap. Will have to load up in Italy!  We get 2 Campari cocktails out of 1 mini, so $1.50 each is tolerable. They get through security just fine, but we do get an occassional question as to what is Campari.
Hello All,  I am flying Y with EK next week. As a BA Gold member I have access to the BA lounge when travelling on any airline. I see on the website of Dusseldorf Airport that both BA and EK are in Pier B. However I also read that EK lounge is in Pier C while the BA lounge is in Pier B Does anybody know if I will easily be able to get to the BA lounge when flying on EK or are BA and EK in different areas/piers?  Thanks!
All current AAdvantage Platinum and AAdvantage Gold members who earned their 2009 elite status are eligible to participate in this offer provided they have flown at least one elite qualifying segment during 2009. Members who participated in the 2009 offer are not eligible to extend their status for the 2010 membership year.   unfortunately, they would need at least one flight but still well worth it for some I would assume!
We had an all female 777 crew (Capt., FO and at least the FA's I could see were female). I'm not a feminist, or much of an anything "ist", but I did have to smile to myself. Its happened to me before in the US but never TATL. This was an entirely good thing!  So was ur experience different then a mixed male/female crew?
I posted the following on the CO Board in March, 2005  Some years ago (as I recall, it was about 1995), I was flying from Houston to LGW, connecting in IAH from LAX. I proceeded to the gate at IAH and presented my BP's to a man working the counter who looked familiar to me as someone I'd seen on the news and depicted in business magazines. I said, "Aren't you Gordon" and before I could say the last name, he interrupted and said, "I'm just another Continental Airlines employee!" Here was the "Head Dude" (Gordon Bethune) working the counter! Certainly not coincidentally, after the DC10 was aloft, an announcement from the flight deck advised pax that the entire flight crew was female The first time, according to the Captain, that an all-woman crew, including the Captain, Co-Pilot, Flight Engineer and the entire Cabin Crew was flying a heavy passenger aircraft to Europe. The Captain obviously had a sense of humor, because she said that "Any passenger that isn't comfortable with that information is welcome to deplane!" Of course, we were ascending to cruising altitude at the time. As I recall, the flight was uneventful and enjoyable. I've made the journey from the US to Europe well over a hundred times in everything from B707's &amp; DC8's with ram-jet engines to the latest Airbus and Boeing Jumbo's, on Carriers from Pan Am, Laker, et al, but that singular CO flight stands out as being one of the most satisfying.     *
You can always walk, but I find that the train is the best way to get between terminals at DFW. Seems to be ~5 min between any terminals. However, DFW is my home airport so I don't often connect there. But, I've never had a problem when I've had to hop from terminal to terminal.
With 2 minutes to wait for a train, and maybe 2 minutes up and 2 minutes down, that gives a maximum of 15 mins. If transferring between low C and high D gates you probably have the longest Skylink ride. Using the bridge to walk is probably no more than 10 min between low low C and high D, so a good option if you are in a hurry, or like the exercise!  As I recall, the bridge is quite easy to find in D, but off a side passage in C, so if coming from C you have to look out for the signs (which are now a little better than they used to be). But from D to C it should not be a problem.
Not sure about the certs, but I have heard that to grant Silver again, you will first need to requalify as CP and then for every 25k miles you earn (in the same program year) you are able to grant another silver.
I agree with the concept of this thread. Some just don't care at all. Hang up and get another one and it's all good. AA, if you're reading this, please take note!
Agree completely, and this scenario is probably what your signature is describing, lol. However, in the spirit of FT, I'm much more aware of the rules that will work to my advantage, and am quick to site such. Rules such as whose CC must be charged are ones I don't spend time familiarizing myself with and deal with as necessary. However, it is AA's job to tell me what/when "necessary" is, not my job to remind them. This agent was lazy and his supervisor was a doofus.
When families gather together warmed nuts are the center piece of the evening. The failure to present warmed nuts to a guest is reason for social ostracization.  Yes, as a people we take our warmed nuts very seriously.  I believe warm nuts predate that. It has been claimed that warm nuts were used thousands of years ago when man was learning how to build tools. Often, the neanderthals would get hungry and resorted to yelling and panic when their stomach acid got the better of them. Those with warm nuts were able to circumvent this and remained focused, thereby giving them the tools necessary to enslave the others, who in turn grew the nuts for their masters.

Not to get off topic, but I have started and sold 4 companies, two of them technology. If it is seniority based lay-offs with little to no regard to performance (cost-benefit), then the shop that you are referencing is either union or has incredibly bad business sense.  Any firing or lay-offs I have been in with the private sector has nothing to do with union. It's all about cost-profit-benefit equation. Sometimes it does make sense to lay-off a more senior person if overall compensation is more than the overall payoff to the business, but that is the same equation that is used in any company that is making profit consistently - regardless of seniority.  Again, that's what is wrong with the airlines - they have no regard to performance, just seniority as it relates to staffing realignments.

Let me know
Or changing the rule regarding date changes on awards from outside 21 days to inside 21 days w/o a fee. That seems more important/likely.
Pilot fatigue is an industry-wide problem and not just an EK problem.  The only difference is that is countries like the USA, due to recent accidents attributed to pilot fatigue, there's legislation in the works to change the rules.

Not exactly the first occurrence of it in this thread either
We got out of order. Next person please use danielacaemelia. Thanks!!
I am planning a flight JFK-BRU-GVA. The lowest fare gives me a connection time of only 1:20 mins in BRU. I know that I will have to clear the immigration and customs in BRU, as the GVA is in the Schengen zone. I'd like to ask the FFyers with recent BRU experience the following:  Is 1:20 mins way to risky ? In particular, do I also have to claim my luggage in BRU, and re-check after the customs ? What is the chance that my luggage would miss the connection (worst case scenario for me) ? Also, are the carry-on rules still strict: only one personal item and no large carry-on bags allowed (US size) ?  Thank you all.
Hi,  I usually travel with my ENZO only  EK or for that sake even DHL or UPS are ok with it as long as they know SCHUMI is gona help me jump start it  Safe Flying
Well, for someone who flew one flight and is being downgraded to Gold perhaps a fee of a couple hundred dollars makes the 100 percent RDM bonus, priority upgrades and lounge access worth it for a lot less than accruing 50,000 EQM - even with the DBEQMs of 2009 But many others have already expressed this on the forum !
In such cases you simply don't see the miles and they don't reply with anything useful to queries anyway.  I don't think the problem is that the OP tried to redeem miles of the same denomination more than once. At least in my case, my SO's and my friends, it is impossible to get that far. If we try to redeem a mileage award that we have already redeemed, it won't let us. When we click on that award we get a message that we have already redeemed for that amount and it it limited to one per household. It has been doing that to us from at least this summer - which is way before the OP put in this redemption request.  The one time I asked for help from customer summer, which I did this fall, I got a response within two weeks which actually reasonably answered my question, so it can be worth asking customer service. There is no guarantee that writing will get you an answer, let alone a useful one, but it can't hurt.  My guess and this is only a guess is that they are just being slow - they have a history of being slow.
Yes, one could do this, but not exactly the way you said. If, for example, they did the Plat challenge in January, 2008, they are Plat for 2008, Gold for 2009, and become dirt on March 1, 2010. At that point, they can start a Plat challenge, fly enough to complete it, and become Plat again, but they would lose status (on March 1, 2010), and would have to fly enough as dirt to satisfy the challenge. If on deep discount fares, that would be 20,000 miles of dirt.
I called the EXP desk to request eVIP's be applied to a r/t DFW-LHR but the agent told me since the fare wasn't ticketed, she was unable to put my request in. I called again and got the same response. So I was just reading these messages from July '09 and assumed that eVIP requests could be applied to tickets on hold?
There is one exception. If the fare on hold is a 'W' fare then you cannot do it. Is you fare a 'W' fare? I tried this a few weeks ago for an LHR-LAX flight and the agent initially said she could apply it to my reservation on hold (but that afterwards I would need to call back the EXP desk to have it ticketed as I no longer would be able to ticket it online) but then when she saw it was a W fare she said I would need to ticket it online first. The reason being that W fares are web-based fares only and they do not have access to that fare code to actually ticket the reservation over the phone - although they can access it once ticketed to apply the eVIP etc (which is what I did afterwards).  In all other cases though, yes you would be able to apply to a reservation on hold.
Those are the regular miles not your tier miles
I didn't realize the 762s were rated for such a long overwater flight.
Hi all, New member here looking for advice. My regular travel profile has meant EK silver status for the past few years, but with the recent changes to Skywards I will fall 1,000 miles short of retaining this in future. I'm hoping to find some way to boost my Tier Miles at the least cost/hassle. My current thoughts are (1) to stopover in DXB on a trip and do a flight to Muscat or Doha and back or (2) to get a paid upgrade on one leg of one trip. I also thought about making making an outbound flight in a separate month from the inbound so if the outbound qualifies me the inbound will count towards the next 13 month period but that's starting to get complicated. As far as I can tell there are no other avenues to gain Tier Miles (affiliates etc).  Any comments on the above or any other suggestions?  Any thoughts on whether it is worth spending a bit extra to stick with one airline to gain the program rewards?  Thanks all.
I applied for and received a (which will post in another 8 weeks or so ) Not a good long to post a measly 500 miles
$0. I don't even use the ones I have.

(Meaning it is a common occurrence and no one even stops to think about it).
Excellent advice indeed.  Unfortunately I have not found an airline serving a Islay in any cabin. I have found some in lounges. JL's NRT F Lounge has a nice selection including some Islays.  scotch anytime after lunch  So does that mean during the lunch meal you have "scotch &amp; dry" ?
100 for sure 300 depending on what i had planned 500 nope
Thanks! I've been wanting a CX award and have never been able to find the seats. Maybe this time will do it.
We had an all female 777 crew (Capt., FO and at least the FA's I could see were female). I'm not a feminist, or much of an anything "ist", but I did have to smile to myself. Its happened to me before in the US but never TATL. This was an entirely good thing!  She was probably hired back around 1977-1980 when very few if any airline had female pilots. I bet she was one of the first females at AA.
I can remember being on an all-female (or, at least, the captain and the first officer) crew on a United JFK-GRU flight in the first half of the 90's.
Or even zero flights
I took a bump voucher and rescheduled for 1/24  I'll be arriving at DCA around 8am for a 10:15 Departure to PHX Flight US75. I can guest 2 into the DCA club. PM me if you'll be around
That is a lot of lurking! Welcome to FT, or perhaps I should just say thanks for posting.
thanksi'll give it try
An all female flight crew of a SeaKing Search / Rescue helicopter was on an RAF PR photo shoot when they got word of a RAF Jaguar aircraft in which crashed due to a bird strike, The single pilot ejected into the sea and his emergency beacon activated.  On being hoisted into the helicopter the pilot saw the loadmaster/hoist operator and swore "bloody hell a woman", the Pilot and Navigator then looked around, the pilot that shouted more "bloody women".  The loadmaster then firmly reminded him, that it was HE who crashed the jet and who was the better aircrew. lol   BM  I was anticipating a crude "I'll take the next one" joke
Yes, indeed. Welcome to the wonderful world of everyone charging baggage fees, and only waiving them for their own elites or alliance partner elites, regardless of codeshare status.  Since AS isn't part of OW, you're up a creek there. Of course, any of us AS elites flying AA have the exact same problem in reverse- getting shafted for baggage fees checking in going PIT-ORD-ANC on AA/AS.  For what it's worth, while AS and DL are about to enter elite reciprocity (unlike AA, which basically treats AS elites like dirt), baggage fee exemptions may not be part of that. Seems like the airlines are kind of addicted to the heroin and are unwilling to give up any revenue opportunities.
It is actually the time of original upgrade request, not purchase time. So, if you put any of these tickets on hold and requested upgrades with the hold, then that is the time that counts for upgrade order.
It might be a larger plane, but going from 762 F/J to 752 F is DEFINITELY a downgauge.
Thanks guys. I'll take the walk and loosen the legs up between flights
Bonus miles have posted today
Upgrades not following ticket purchase timesmoking gun?  My family of 5 exps always travels in separate record locatorseasier to compete for the upgrades. This leads for upgrades clearing at different times.  I have never formally checked AAs systems formally, but sometimes I have wondered why upgrades have happened in specific orders.  My wife is currently waiting for an upgrade. I cleared that upgrade 2 days ago. That flight still has 6 empty seats. Yet I her ticket was bought first and ticketed first (even if only by minutesI have the email confirmations),  Is this a smoking gun that there is more to time of purchase / request for upgrade requests?  I will more careful records going forward and see if I can see any patterns.
Ditto. As a matter of fact, I placed one on hold yesterday and requested the upgrades. The email came and it had my RT as well as a second RT stating waitlisted (so 4 flight segments on the intinerary). Today, I called to book it and the seats had already been upgraded to C inventory prior to me booking the res.  It is indeed possible. Hang up and redial.
It's pretty common to get an agent who doesn't know the rules as well as we do. Happens all the time to most of us. If you don't experience this, you need to spend more time on FT learning the rules.
I booked flights online, called to apply the upgrades, then had upgrades clear while the reservation was still on hold.  because it is a WEB fare (W). When you place a hold online and apply an eVIP you have to then ticket over the phone afterwards, correct? since it is a WEB based fare they have no access to that fare code to ticket it over the phone so while they can apply the SWU to the held reservation they cannot ticket it afterwards. Therefore the only alternative is to ticket it first and then apply the eVIP. That being said, I don't see how this is a big deal in the first place since you can only hold a reservation for a day. It is unlikely to have a big impact on your probability of the upgrade clearing IME.
That is part of my point. They can't be angry that furloughs are based on seniority rather than performance if it's the union (that they all run) that makes the rule. It would be like me voting for someone who says they will double taxes, and then being upset when they do it. Unless I misunderstand how it works, the employees run the union, and the union set the rules on seniority.
[actually. [Totally agree - the website (as discussed in other threads) is total and utter shite!  I do love flying with them though AG.
if the booking site you are using has multicity, then plug in what you wantor call the airlinegood luck
Don't pay the bill early. (Well, sort of)  I had the Chase Southwest card for something like 5 years. I paid it in full every 4th Thursday (every 28 days). In 2008 I paid it August 3, August 31, Sept 28 and Oct 26. My bill had one week lag time between one month's due date and the next month's closing date; during that time and payments made are credited to the previous month, not the current month. They actually sent me a bill with a ZERO balance and a $35 late fee. Huh? I tried the online chat with them assuming there was some kind of error. And their agent told me I was charged a late fee because I made the payment early. No kidding!  They did reverse the fee, but basically told me not to make payments during the week between the due date and closing date unless I was also going to make another payment that calendar month.  I loved the rewards but hated Chase, so I closed the account.
Typically, the other *A members won't match a fellow alliance member's elite status. There seems to be a pretty strong anti-poaching commitment among the *A airlines.  That being said, there have been reports of some people being successful.
She's more than welcome to find another pair of seats if she's trying to save a highly coveted seat like the front or the exit row. You're not going to convince me that those are the only two seats next to each other on the plane.  I did read it. I was talking about saving the seat. And I'm sure she did save a seat for her daughter, and if anyone made a fuss, the FA would have had to stop him/herself from laughing in the whiner's face.
kgisborne, I generally agree with your line of reasoning, and the information given to you by FB confirms what has been pointed out in many threads here on FT.  However, things might have changed recently. If I have understood things correctly (and also other threads here on FT suggest that this is the case), the recently introduced year counter on the website changes on 1 Apr. So now, with the year counter in place, I would not be surprised if you read on the website on 1 Apr that you are a LTPE member.  It would be cool if you could come back to this thread on 1 Apr and let me know if my guess was correct or if your official recognition will indeed take place next year (i.e. in accordance with FB's common practice during the past years).
If sitting next to a friend or someone else is so important to you,then board later with them.  You will never win this argument. I guarantee the average pax reading this post (not the uppity types) think the fact this is an argument is crazy. Note: I fly WN 1 RT per week, 99% of the time alone. Anyone who has a problem with saving seats needs to get their priorities in life reexamined.
I'm new at this so forgive me please if this is an idiotic, naive question  This is my first promo and I did not see the fine print on the macy's site that a macy's gift card could not be purchased and be eligible for this promo. I read "shop at five stores", which I did. I read and reread the introductory promo page and I followed those instructions. I shopped at five stores.  Do you think there is any chance that US Airways might give me the miles for my macy's purchase considering that I followed their directions and wound up with one missing store?  Thank you.
Common sense dictates you sit in the seat you want, and deal with having to be separated by a couple of feet from your friend or loved one for the next couple hours of your life. You'll see them again soon, it'll be okay, I promise.  Someone ALWAYS moves in this situation so the husband and wife can sit together. I've never seen a situation where they don't.
This is not just a matter of collecting some extra revenue, although that is important. To the extent people check fewer bags, it cuts the expense on ground crews and also frees up space in the hold for air freight, which pays a lot more than $25 a bag. And here's a guess. For all the huffing and puffing about gaining passengers, WN is finding out what CO did when it marketed itself as being fee-free a couple of years ago. The real or imagined gains in market share do not offset the money left on the table by BFF. But WN is so heavily invested in BFF, they are now sounding out focus groups on ideas such as change fees on tickets to try to make up the difference. Of course, with the 5 percent gain in passengers, you have to remember that WN is still playing catchup with the legacies on load factor. That doesn't even get into calculations of yield, but we are starting to see the push especially here in LAS. As US has dismantled its hub here, the "Southwest effect" 2.0 is rising fares as it now has monopolies on several routes in the West, such as to SAN and ABQ, where it formerly had competition. And not to forget, this fabulous business model has led to net losses in four of the last five quarters and going to airports such as LGA and BOS that the swore would NEVER happen. With the secondary airport strategy, WN was being pushed into discount irrelevance in major metro areas by carriers such as B6 and AT, that weren't afraid of the big city airports.  Get back to me when WN has a $1500 walk-up fare.  Generally, your post is a bit dramatic. How many profitable quarters have any other airlines had lately? Profitable years? You tell me.
That's nice. I was talking about her outrage at her daughter not being allowed to board with her in the A group. And yet, somehow, you decided that "my argument will never be won".
I have been enjoying the occasional upgrades at the LAX counter since I have got to known one of the upper-level service lady. For some reason in HK I usually find myself upgrading my ticket using miles from a regular Y class ticket. So essentially what I want out of my Diamond membership is the thrill of getting a random upgrade, the 20kg baggage bonus, lounge service and the personal introduction from the head stewardess if I fly economy.  Is it possible for me to get any of the domestic (USA) carriers to match my diamond membership?  Then maybe OZ is the right program for you. By the way, you don't have to fly LH or BD to be in their FFP. You can just use the program for benefits. I am not sure whether UA or CO would status match, you would need to check the respective forums for this.
OP: I'd suggest you get over it. I have the right to sit anywhere that's open, and common sense dictates I have the right to sit next to my friend, colleague or family member. WN does not have assigned seating, and you know this. You have no guarantee of ever getting the exact seat you want.
Sigh. Wish Jetblue hadn't left BNA.  It just creates more issues later when folks don't speak up, IMO.
Absolutely. I will keep an eye out on April 1st, and let you know if I'm pleasantly surprised or not!
I just booked two award tickets, all in business class:  BSL-FRA-MEX (taxes, approx Â£256) (all flights on LH)  PVR-IAH-DCA(stopover) IAD-FRA-BSL (taxes, approx Â£460) (PVR-IAD-DCA on CO, IAD-FRA-BSL on LH)  The taxes, particularly on the second flight, seem very high. Can someone help point me to where I can calculate the correct taxes for the flights, and in the case of a discrepency, what the best course of action with the ICC is? I've already booked the tickets and paid the tax via credit card (as there was very limited availability on the routes, and I'd rather have overpriced tickets than no tickets at all).  Many thanks!
I like how we're apparently the "uppity" ones, but you seem to be the only one in this thread resorting to name calling and insults. That amuses me.
I'm a new member and one of these FF who is 'obsessed' with SW Airlines. I just think they provide the best value and customer service.  I just recently became aware of the Companion Pass which you get after 100 credits of any kind. I don't fly every week or anything but I have done well in banking RR credits with hotel stays along with flights.  This sounds like a good deal and I'm considering a full court press this Spring to get to 100 credits (the Chase Card, Hotel Promos etc).  My question is..is it worth it? Is it easy to use and can you use it alongside a RR awards ticket or does it have to be a revenue flight.  My suspicion is that it works great, like most SW programs but I wanted some feedback from those who have one.  Thanks!  Works well except for the few little things mentioned by InkUnderNails.  IMO the best deal out there for airline elites. I save thousands of dollars a year (tax-free) with the CP.  Try to get the 100th credit as early in the month as you can; you get 13 months PLUS the rest of the month in which you qualify.  Go for it.
That's because people are generally good. Not because they have a "right" to sit together.
My 23 932 FB miles are going to expire on Feb 2010. I'm not taking any Air France/KLM flights in the near future, so there's no way to extend their expiry.  Seeking the board's advice for suggestions on how to spend these miles!  Thanks!
Hmm. Well, FB doesnt allow me to login at the moment (Some kind of technical maintenance) so I was unable to check but I believed that Europe-Asia roundtrips started at 40-50K, and EU-US roundtrips at 25K?
Welcome to FT, emkat76!  Without knowing the fare rules we can't really comment. But as a rule of thumb, those cheap tickets don't allow date changes unless you pay a high change fee. So you must make sure that the stopover is scheduled before you buy the ticket or pay the price.
you can try to fly with China Southern, maybe? Find a cheap ticket within Asia/China?
Someone who posted the topic "North American Summer Highlights" said that ICN-SFO-ICN being the 747-400 will replace the 777 on that route. I hope it can continue through the Winter and next spring, too. Everywhere else, it said it was temporary.  And I can relate this, because ATL is getting the 772 so the 772 from SFO is being used for ATL's second flight from ICN.  Correct me if I'm wrong on this oneand also i've seen that the winter schedule for ATL's second daily hasn't been updated so when it's updated, SFO will continue to see it.
I live in Asia which the online shopping portal doesn't ship to  One alternative is to extend the miles. I flew on kingfisher recently. Anyone with experience on whether that will extend my miles' validity?  FB rules seem to rule that out:
Yes, I believe that so. I'm pretty confident where another airlines will joins into SkyTeam anytime soon. I'm looking for which airlines who hasn't joining into the alliance yet.
Interesting idea on the 5.5 credits, but I can't seem to find that promotion anywhere, so either my search skills are complete shot tonight, or it no longer exists. Care to point me in the right direction?
I imagine that Management has one idea of fairness and how it should play out (hence the pre-board exclusion and FAA seating rules) while Operations (F/A's) only have a common goal of getting everyone in a seat (ANY seat) and the plane pushed back as soon as possible. Caring about anything else in between falls in the grey middle of "it can go either way".  I just took my first Jet Blue flight after 10 years of WN exclusively. What a civilized, pleasant experience not because of the seating but of the TV &amp; Satellite radio which is ON continuously from boarding through exiting except for the safely announcements. Get this installed and no one is going to care what seat they are in!
Uhhuh. And how does this "common sense" apply when we're down to the C group, and a husband and wife board to find only middle seats left. Do they have the "right" to tell people who've already claimed seats that they have to move, so that they can sit together?  Common sense dictates you sit in the seat you want, and deal with having to be separated by a couple of feet from your friend or loved one for the next couple hours of your life. You'll see them again soon, it'll be okay, I promise.
Sorry-you are wrong on this one. If you board in front of me for whatever reason and I come along wanting a seat you are trying to save,it is mine.  If sitting next to a friend or someone else is so important to you,then board later with them.
I'm really angry now because Bose has really messed things up for me. I purchased the QC15 headphones on 12/1 but then returned them on 12/18, with it posting to my CC on 12/20.

I don't understand why they would post additional miles if I returned the product more than a month ago!  THIS PUSHED MY LARGEST AND ONLY TIB PURCHASE out of the 10 purchases that qualify for the bonus I sent an email to , is there anything else that I should do to make sure these Bose transactions get removed? I'm hoping that there is something I can do, but if all else fails I can always return the TIB items if they aren't going to qualify because they just arrived in the mail today 1/23. Nevertheless, I'm still freaking out that this whole thing might be blown.  Should I try to contact Bose? Anyone have an email address that they recommend I use to contact Bose?

You mean o/w rather than round trip presumably? There were some promos with Asia-Europe o/w at 20-23K miles on some routes but these are for travel by 31 Jan.
Well, 1) it wasn't my argument to win, but 2) it was won. If you had read the original save a highly coveted seat like the front or the exit row. You're not going to convince me that those are the only two seats next to each other on the plane.
The problem is that you are coming back from Mexico with a business class ticket. This attracts a business class tax ex-Mexico which is calculated as if it were a full price ticket.  I was stung with the same thing last year when making redemptions to Mexico. The only way round it was to re-book it as a return booking, which saved a couple of hundred pounds. If your two one ways haven't been ticketed, you can cancel them for free and try to re-book the flights as a return to save money. The downside is that the seats may not all become available again on cancellation. It depends on whether you fancy taking a punt on it to save some money.
While in general 25k miles is enough for a nice award ticket, from within Asia it does not hold that much value. All flight to/from Asia cost (way) more than 25K miles.  However if liyuhua does regularly fly outside of Asia, 25K miles could be enough for a simple Europe-US roundtrip in Y. If that is something that sounds interesting/useful, I would agree with neuromancer and try to get an additional 1100 miles.  General wondering: If you buy miles at klm.com, does that extend the validity? Otherwise you could indeed consider renting a car, hotel, stuff like that.
I absolutely agree. If the seat is open you have the right to it. Common sense dictates you can sit next to your friend, colleague or family member, someone else's friend, colleague or family member, or even a stranger. Setting up some silly rule to allow people to reserve seats as suggested by the OP, even if it's non-exit row middle seats, makes no sense. If you want a seat, it's open, and you want to sit next to the person in the adjacent seat, sit there. Those are the rules, that's common sense.
You left your 12 year old behind because she had a B boarding pass  Apparently a seat is way more important than your daughter. Family boarding is effectively at A61. That's NOT a bad spot for boarding.  Back on topic, instead of asking if the seat is taken, firmly move to take the seat which puts the other person on the defensive.  I agree its silly that gate agents don't let spouses together but then advise the first boarder to just save a seat. Its only pushing the problem onto the plane instead of suggesting that the first boarder stick around for the second boarder.  For anyone that is concerned about sitting together, they can figure out when buying tickets that there are no seat assignments at which point they can opt for the extra charge to ensure they board early.
It's two promotions actually check out the thread in this forum about the Hyatt Promo to earn an extra 2.5 credits per stay in that thread is details (and links to register I believe) for both
I just got my RR Chase Signature card in the mail so I open it and call the number on the sticker on the front to activate it. Well I actually get a human on the other end of the phone Every other card I have it was an automated process. So the person was tring to sell me some protection plan, after about 5 minutes of barley understanding what he was talking about I asked him is this going to cost me something, he said yes, I said I want to opt out. Then I was asked if I want to delay enrollment 2 weeks it will become activeFinally the card was activated. Holy Cow I've never had this happen It must be common, there is more. So I re read the info they send me and this is another number to call to set up a pin. So I figure I'll call them gotta be and automated pin set up thingnope another human. He tells me the card has not been activated yetThis one tries to sell me fraud and idenity theft protection that will automatically be charged every month for about $10 per. I said no thanks I called to set up a pin for my card, well that is another phone number. Are they kidding me aren't I a new customer that they are trying to stick it to Now I call the 3rd. number and finally get the automated machine to make my pin.  Does this happen all the time with major credit cards? Anything else to be on the lookout for? Any words of advice or warning.
I've looked before at those cheap tickets. All the ones I saw were booked into V class and it specifically prohibits a stopover of any sort in ICN. Would be great for me if they did allow the stopover as I'd have plenty of uses for that kind of a ticket.
Get over yourself. She can board at her place and save her daughter's seat. You're not going to win this argument with any FA or fellow passenger.
Kingfisher will not extend the validity, it is not in Skyteam. Better donate them to charity, or if you can add some 1100 miles (hotels, AMEX, e-rewards) you can probably get a short award flight for 25000.
Hi! I am planning a trip to Thailand in July and will be traveling round trip JFK-ICN-BKK. Found a great fare on vayama for the trip but we wanted to stop in Seoul for two nights on the way out. Is it possible to make a stopover like this? If I book online (and vayama doesn't tell you what class the ticket is when they issue it), will Asiana let me switch the ICN-BKK leg?  Any thoughts appreciated!
You could donate those miles to AirCareor use them to buy something via the Air France website - they have an E-Shopping portal. You may be lucky enough to get a teatowel for that amount of miles! Whatever you dodon't let Flying Blue have the pleasure of just writing the miles off.
Exactly how many seats does one person have the right to save, in your world?
If you think that is a great redemption I have a bridge to sell you.
thank you very much!
Aah, it came across to me that LH F was being used as a benchmark of poor F Class and BA had sunk below that, rather than LH F having merit in its own right.
US CP here, I needed to book a flight from Northeast to San Diego for 5 people, with limited miles. I looked on US, all they had was for 50,000 miles per person, I was looking for 25k per person. USairs site showed NO other airlines flights.  I switched to Continental, and found reward flights on CO and UA, all available on CO site, but when I called the CP desk, they said those flights are only available to use CO miles for this, not US miles. They were unable to accommodate me out of MDT, BWI or PHL. Now I have to drive to IAD for my award travel which sucks.  Is this true?  Also, flying on UA as a US-CP, (*a gold) will I have to pay to check bags?  You should use the ANA tool (there's info about that here and in other threads in this forum) to find Star Alliance award inventory for the CO and UA flights you're looking at. If they are available there, they are available via US -- you just may have to keep calling until you find an agent who can book them. Just because something is available on the CO site for CO members, doesn't necessarily mean that it's available to partner airlines. That's where the ANA tool comes in, as it shows what CO and UA have made available to their partners and the vast majority of the time, if you get someone at US who knows what they're doing, they'll be able to book those flights for you.  Yes, as a Star Gold, there are no baggage fees for you and those on your same itinerary. You get 3 bags each for free.
you have confirmed my suspicions. I was booked on BA10 F award but saw QF1 pop up this morning on the same departure date and switched across the award
Any thoughts? I'm scheduled on this flight tomorrow, after taking a bump voucher on Friday.   I'd bet it's the headwinds. The storms coming in from the Pacific have been guided by a very strong west-to-east flow. It's also possible that that particular flight already had a lot of cargo scheduled to be included, which added to the need to cut weight in combination with the headwinds.
I stopped shopping at Randalls after Safeway bought them out and brought down their quality. I miss the day when the Randall family still owned and ran the joint.
The barrista is only available on weekdays too (and until 9:30 as noted).
The NZ lounge is miles better and considering that the QF J lounge should be one of their most important lounges it the experience falls short of most peoples expectations.  Its abit like the NZ Koru Lounge at AKL, its the why bother at our home port lounge.
What's wrong with LH F?  Based on the trip reports I read on FT, seems like an excellent product other than the actual seat being a generation behind suite products. The soft product seems decent.  World class First Class Terminal, direct at aircraft limo drop off service for pax, decent catering, etc.    Doesn't seem that bad to me.
+1  The Air NZ Koru Lounge makes the QF Lounge seem rather tragic  The food offerings in the QF Lounge seem to disappear in an instant Like a pack of vultures descending  I very rarely eat in lounges as I wait for the meal service onboard, however, I do p

Keep in mind, while North American summer is winter, thus emptier, this Summer FIFA 2010 will be held in Jo'Burg and Cape Town, so it will be very crowded!  You can fly SAA nonstop from JFK to JNB, so you don't even have to go through Europe if you prefer a shorter flight time.    CLTUSCAPTIVE, I'm doing HKG and 2 weeks in BKK for Summer 2010.

I have been to Kuredu which had nice sites nearby. But this time, I was thinking of trying Four Seasons LG OR Conrad Rangali. TIA
Doesn't seem that bad to me.  Which is why I said that it is now better than BA F! Quite a change from 10 years ago (when BA F was easily twice as good as LH F). But how close to SYD/MEL does LH F get? Within 3000 miles? Makes for a long swim (or slum it on SQ ).
If anybody cares, I was sucessful in getting a full refund on my flight insurance. I contacted the insurance company, and faxed them credit card receipts and flight reservation, and got my refund.
True. I gave up two confirmed F upgrades (which also surprised me, as it was a UA ticket) for 21C, but getting home 15 minutes before the kids' bed time vs. 45 minutes after outweighs an F seat any day.
Which is why its always good to check seat maps and assignments regularly before a flight
No, there are plenty of travel sites that aggregate fares from airline sites - Kayak, etc. Mine is a corporate portal. I don't feel right charging my client $600 for a direct flight when I can leave an hour earlier, get home an hour later (with an 80% chance of getting the direct flight anyway) for $200. I treat my client's money like my own - I've found that works well.
Rather than starting a new thread, I figured I'd post a similar question on here.  I'm flying SYD-SCL soon and am currently only SG. However I'm booked on LA800 rather than the Qantas codeshare. Does this mean I will or won't have access to the QP in SYD? It's the first time I've been booked on this flight number, and my reading of the Qantas website seems to suggest I won't have access because I'm not booked on the QF codeshare? Can anybody clarify?  Thanks in advance
i just flew in to SYD from SFO this morning. Booked Y but was able to select PE seats, which we got. Don't think the flight was full.
I would suggest that knowing what you are not entitled to, is just as relevant as knowing what you are entitled to.  Not really, as the Chairmans Lounge is not signed, nor promoted in any way. If you didn't know where the lounge was, you wouldn't know it existed beyond that frosted glass door.  The OP asked about Lounges they are entitled to (specifically the different between the QP and the J lounge).
I wonder if you can register your Safeway card with a PDX/SEA/ANC address and switch to AS miles, or with another address and get UA miles, even at Randall's.  I know whenever I shop at a Safeway in another region, or at a SWY-owned brand, it stills adds up towards my MileagePlus account.
I discovered on my last trip that I know the spa manager! He gave me his card with phone and email, so I'd suggested requesting that for future trips as the cards are clearly for distribution. Sam is a very nice guy and I'm sure would accommodate such requests.
There seem to be no business class fares to GCM for some of Dec 2010 and Jan 2011, WT+ and WT exist. Anyone know why (NAS is the same, as its the same flight) thanks Joejet
Coffee is prepared by barista only until 9:30AM in both lounges.
I noticed Experflyer was noted earlier as a method of finding award availability. Does it also track avail for QF partner flights? eg BA.
Better food choice. Had warm scones and jam/cream in the J lounge which I have not seen in the club lounge.
I was scheduled on US Airways Flight 75 DCA to PHX 1/22. They called for 7 volunteers due to weight restrictions, not due to an oversold flight. The flight was on a Airbus 319. Is it common this time of year to be weight restricted on this flight? Is it because of the aircraft, DCA?, headwinds?  Any thoughts? I'm scheduled on this flight tomorrow, after taking a bump voucher on Friday.
The OP was only referring to lounges they could access though. Chairmans Lounge Membership is by invitation only and grants access to all three lounges.
This is so stupid, esp considering that so many tiny little places are on the list!
I hope they'll announce one before late February. I have about 10 flights lined up for the year
Dave  Which makes sense of course, however looking at this table here  It shows that SG has the same access as paid QP members. And that + sign has the footnote "+next onward flight that day must be on a Qantas, British Airways or Jetstar flight number."  So has Qantas stuffed up the data in this table?
Sure, most people who have a choice route on QF instead of BA these days, BA seems to be running quite empty in the F cabin this year. Almost every BA flight that I have checked has F award availability every month (often for every day of the month) -- quite a stunning change from a couple of years ago. By contrast QF on overlapping routes is often full.
Have the hairbrush scars settled down yet?  She's yet to catch meI'm too quick for someone her age.

Thanks in advance  As a OW Sapphire member you can use lounges when travelling on flights both marketed by and operated by an OW airline. Since the flight is both marketed by and operated by a OW airline, then yes you will have access
Good points, but I've found QF F catering ex-MEL to be better than ex-SYD (maybe fewer meals to prepare so more attention to detail, or just better staff or ingredient availability than in SYD). Interesting how the same food can be so different sometimes
I have yet to score voucher. Is there a pattern or trend when it comes to US needing volunteers? My travel is almost always flexible and it would be great to score these. I suppose the downside is that if I give up a seat in F, I may be in the middle of row 34 on the later flight.  Speaking of celebs, my FA on a Dash-8 flight yesterday told me she once had Manute Bol on one of her flights. Can you imagine that guy on a Dash-8?
Mrs Bjornstrom did ARN-HEL-HKG on AY leaving Saturday morning but arrived late to HKG, missed the connection to SYD and is now stuck. There's no availability on CX/BA and even SQ/TG is full.  She's been offered HKG-PVG-SYD-MEL routing on China Eastern &amp; Qantas in Y (she's got a paid C ticket) but declined. For a few minutes they got a C-class ticket on SQ HKG-SIN-MEL but it disappeared before they got to ticket it.  At the moment they're discussing whether to put her in SQ R (Suites) but that doesn't seem likely, does it?  She's not happy and Cathay Pacific doesn't really care enough to do something about it. So she's sitting in a airconditioned terminal with no ticket, no flight and no lounge access at the moment waiting for some chinese supervisor to get back for the last hours.
Ne'er a truer word   I'd guess more ex-BKK and the problem exists there.
I was in the QF SYD International Business Lounge in the afternoon on Boxing Day last year (was flying SQ that day and could not use the F lounge) and it was not too bad.  I finished the smoked salmon tray twice (it was very nice and lost count how many slices I had eaten ), did some printing, had several Crown Lagers and also stocked up on some water and Crown Lagers for my overnight transit in SIN.
Yeah, you have been lucky and *A Gold.  I have tried all the alliances and I have ended up to this kind of situations with all of them. I think there is a group of people who will experience all of these problems so rest of the people do not need to bother with these problems.  I will head to AY forum to see what you wrote there.
Safeway is canceling the agreement with all four airlines (AA, AS, CO, UA).  Probably need pizza for the beer, as the six-packs are usually ineligible for credit.
How about Croatia? Or if you are adventurous, Vietnam. (Not sure how easy it is to get there on Star Alliance.)
One of the subtle differences is that the wine quality is better in the J-lounge.
Headwinds is probably the reason. It is kind of surprising to me - any W&amp;B issues I've had were on smaller planes and shorter routes. I've made pitstops at MCI and elsewhere when flying cross-country. I would have thought that would be easier than leaving pax behind.  ETA: That flight took 4:58 to fly, while the reverse direction flight 46 on the same day took 3:30  ETA, more: Ground speeds for 737's between PHX and the east coast on the 22nd - &lt;500 westbound, &gt;730 eastbound (flightaware says mach 1.11 - not really, but relative to groundspeed, I assume)
year? Maybe this clip will help you decide - not just for the 2010 Winter Olympics but later on in the year.  Been twice. Yes indeed, it is a great city surrounded by wonderful scenery. I especially like the sunshine coast areavery quiet and peaceful.
I have just had the same retime.  Now have a 3 Hour Connection at IAH after having to take the earlier connector,  But its the equipment change that bugs me, I booked this run as I prefer the 777. Now have the 767-400 on the IAH-LHR Leg. Seems more cramped and more difficult to sleep on  EDIT - Managed to get changed onto the Earlier CO34 IAH-LHR as the earlier connection made that a legal connect now, so back to the 777!.  To the OP: Give them a call and see what they can work out rather than waiting for them to call you.
I book through a company-mandated travel agency website and my last trip CLT-LGA-BOS was $130 cheaper booking the UA codeshare than THE EXACT SAME FLIGHTS on US! For the life of me I can't figure out the logic that US uses to try to get a premium for tickets on the same exact planesI did check the nonstop on US, it was, literally, over 3 times the price of the connection. I can see charging a reasonable premium, say $50 - $100 for the nonstop, but not three times the connection fare ($600 more). If this is their strategy for returning to profitability, I think they are serious trouble.
I for one do appreciate your reporting your experience here on the board - thanks!
There is no SYD-MEL F service (it is J); any F flight departing SYD is eligible for reserving a spa booking. Arrival into SYD in F is not eligible (so F SIN-SYD and then J SYD-MEL cannot prebook, for example). There are very few treatments per day so chances are in the &lt;1% range if not pre-booked. The pre-booking process works very well and the treatments are significantly higher quality than the LHR spa treatments, as a point of comparison.
She stalks your every post .. you should be more careful!
I think this is pretty decent considering how easy you can get Points.
They'll pick it up eventually and call you. But if you want to resolve it now, you can contact them.  A couple things to keep in mind in this situation:  - Look at other CO options -- either other flights via IAH or EWR. Feel free to suggest what you want to the agent.  - Check the fares now. If the fare is now lower, call CO and let them know about the schedule change. They'll try to find a solution, but try to find something wrong with each solution (e.g., "I don't wanna go thru EWR," or "That one leaves too early, I can't make it."). After a couple "good faith" attempts to resolve this ask if they can just refund the ticket (INVOL Refund). They should refund it to the original form of payment, then you can buy a new ticket at the lower price.
The saddest part is Randalls use to rule the Houston market. In fact, I think they push Safeway/Appletree out of the market back in the late 80s early 90s. Now if HEB would get into MILES
Am I correct in assuming that you either A) have a travel budget or B) have to foot the bill for your travel?  It would have never occured to me to check another website for better pricing as it doesn't come out of my pocket. Now, obviously if the 4:00 flight is $800 and the 6:30 is $300, I'm on the 6:30, but other than that, it is what it is.
Agreed!  But ranting here does help us to work out whether out ranting is justified
QANTAS is a business, not a concierge service. And as a customer, you are free to take your business elsewhere (and complain to QF management). Ranting here does nothing to solve the problem. If enough people complain to QF or take their business elsewhere, then perhaps QF will fix the problem.  You are very wrong about this!  QANTAS is a business and we all know that. As a business they should pay attention to polish their business model and make the business as firm as possible. One way to strangthen their business is to not let any customer feel helpless and leave for your competiters.  I am personally not the one who will leave QANTAS and go anywhere else in short notice. Because I like Qantas. And I hope it could be better. Abandon would not happen until I see signs that Qantas management is not making an affort to make this business better. Then I will leave.  Clearly there is an issue in the QANTAS Asian version of website. We discuss this matter here, and most of us, hope that QANTAS can finally notice that and change that. It is not difficult to have one hassle free online booking website. One of the best example is AA.  Again i support Dave Noble regarding rules. But in Airline and Hotel business there is fundamental rules which can not be changed (e.g. different booking class to collect points), and there is soft landing rules, which can be adjusted case by case. One of the best example is the assisstant booking fee. If Qantas is not offering alternative method of booking, or the alterlative method is disfunctional, the fee should be waived under any country's customer protection scheme (well you may argu AU is different).  In one word, one great Airline knows how to make the journey seamless from the moment passenger start to search for his/her ticket. QANTAS have done very well, but, Out port networks in Asia need to do some fundamental changes.
Dave  To me, customer service plain and simple (no adjectives) = agents consistently applying the rules.  'Good' or 'great' customer service = going a little bit beyond what is required to try and help someone achieve what they want (if it is possible to do so).  In this case there are many alternatives that could have been offered scan of the card, presentation of the card at the transfer desk, presentation of the card at the Qantas office in London or at the airport in London.  It seems what is considered 'good' customer service by the majority could be considered bad customer service by you. For example, let's take Tiger airwars and their strict 45 minute check-in cut off time. I would consider it great customer service if I arrived at T-43 and was still allowed to check in. You would consider that bad service because the agent was not applying the rules consistently?  Another case is this I was trying to book a multi-city ticket on Qantas, out of MEL to Shanghai then returning from SIN. Using the map I did the outbound, but for the return SIN was greyed out. I could however choose from BKK, MNL, BOM, HKG or CGK.  I rang QF and got a junior (non premium) agent. He accepted SIN was greyed out, but instead of saying 'look, I'll go and see why' he simply said 'the fare is $x, plus there'll be a $60 (or whatever it is) telephone booking fee'.  I asked if the booking fee could be waived because for some reason the internet greyed out SIN. His response was 'not everything is possible on the internet and just because the internet doesn't allow you to do it doesn't mean we have to waive the fee'.  So he was applying the 'rules' - but was that good customer service? I would say no - you would say yes?  Thirdly then, many of us have booked awards and asked the assisted booking fee be dropped because we can't book it ourselves on the net. I would say that is good service, but as this rule is not applied consistently to all passengers does that make it bad service?  I know many people will say 'if you don't like the rules then move to another airline'.  This is exacly what I have done. Last year I did 40 or so international flights on Qantas (and Oneworld). This year it's all moved to Star. Better award availability, cheaper reward rates, consistent increased baggage allowance across all airlines in the alliance, better quality of food (SQ and TG), and special meal requests that take account of what I want (no fish) instead of being squeezed in to some pre-existing category on Qantas which ends up giving me a meal I don't want.  So somewhere the 'good customer service' model of Qantas isn't working as best it could. The only real reason I may fly Qantas now is for their premium economy to HKG where I think they offer the best product at a good price.
I would be taking whichever has availability. That is generally the driving factor with F awards.
Best I can tell the J and QP lounges are identical (didn't it use to be a single lounge, both J and QP in the same room?). Same furnishings, amenities, service, food and drink; if there is a difference, it is subtle. So the primary difference is that J lounge is more exclusive (Emerald and paid J access, while QP is Sapphire and paid club access). That may or may not make it less crowded and more enjoyable on any given day. Bottom line is that it really doesn't matter which lounge you use, they are substantially the same. It isn't like the F lounge in SYD, which is completely different and worth seeking out.
I always check the codeshare partner's website just in case it shows a cheaper fare. Most of my travel is leisure, which comes out of my pocket. Why pay more than you need to -- even if it's your employer's money? I guess some of you work for companies with very large pockets. At my smaller company, I feel personally responsible to locate the lowest fare -- within reason, of course.
all good points. Thanks
Air New Zealand has a superb business class so my first instinct is to suggest Australia or some island in the South Pacific with a stopover in New Zealand (just be sure to get out of Auckland).  My next thought would be head down to Cape Town, South Africa and then do a safari in either South Africa or fly up to see the Victoria Falls and do a safari in Botswana. I did the latter this past spring and it was phenomenal.  Southeast Asia would be another phenomenal destination. SQ is not offering many premium class transoceanic awards these days so you may have to fly on Thai or route through Europe and fly Swiss (very nice new Business Class) or Turkish on a 77W which has the minisuite style business class seats. You could spend some time in a big city like BKK on a stopover then continue on to a beach area like Bali or the Maldives.
Does it also track avail for QF partner flights? eg BA.

AA is no different in charging for booking awards over the phone and for non AA travel the only way to do so is over the phone with differing fees depending on the country contacted.  AA charges USD20 in US, GBP20 in UK, AUD60 in Australia  As far as taxes goes, AA charges taxes in accordance to the country of ticket issuance. e.g. booking a domestic AU flight; issued by AA Australia then GST is charged, issued in UK, no GST  regarding QF, The situation of a case where it cannot be booked online is irrelevent in this case since it can be done online subject to the credit card restrictions. The Assisted booking fee is charged for bookings which cannot poosibly be done online
'Good' or 'great' customer service = going a little bit beyond what is required to try and help someone achieve what they want (if it is possible to do so).  I disagree. You might think that but I don't agree. Good customer service is where the staff know the rules and apply correctly unlike , say ime, some US carriers where telephone staff make things up as they go along and how they think it ought to be   Consistency is also good imo. It is poor service to provide inconsistent service where customer A gets told one thing and customer B gets another.  If the rules are applied correctly and consistently to all then that is good and fair to all. If one person whines enough and gets fees removed but others have to pay it, that is poor service imo
Well, things have not moved on from my earlier post. There are good financial reasons why BA do this the way they do, and any amount of whinging by people who book cheaper fares well in advance is not going to change it.  I am a BA Gold. I always book fully flex Bus tickets. Without exception at short notice. Lots of other people have to do the same. I dont think I have ever booked a discount restricted ticket. BA, a private company, for sound business reasons, keep a portion of the aircraft available for just this type of passenger. The money they make from us makes it worthwhile to fly the aircraft.  As was said earlier, life is not fair - learn to live with it. This is a contract if you get the early offer of a cheap seat you are being offered a CW seat in a particular part of the aircraft at a particular price. In contract law that is offer and acceptance. If you want to buy a different seat then the offer will be different ie a higher price. You can take it and get your pick, but the lower discount price gets you a restricted choice.  They are not going to release those valuable seats to all and sundry until the last minute and miss the chance of me buying one at full whack at possibly 3 times what the discount purchaser has paid. When I have to buy a business seat at less than T-24 I dread seeing what is left after the holidaymakers have had their fill!!
I hope you're not a Eurocheat Gold you little devil?
swordfish210, welcome to FlyerTalk.  You can use either of the lounges. The Business lounge is likely going to be a better, but there is not much difference.
Well, thanks for all the various replies! I have at T24hrs grabbed a single UD seat several times SEA - LHR, however this coming summer there will only be 1 daily flight, a reduction from 2, so more pressure on C seats overall. There will still be 2 747's from YVR daily. What is really irritating with BA is they do not show the seat map with what is available prior to booking! They could at least do this for Exec members. Most carriers show what seats are open prior to making a res.
There is a difference between bad service and bad policies. The QF agents have no choice other than to follow the rules set up by their employer. Calling this bad customer service doesn't do justice to the performance of the agents. However, that the policies itself are not customer friendly is an entirely different matter and I can only agree, that by doing this QF makes it hard for people to spend money, not easy.
Better ingredient availability in MEL? I would have thought there would be no difference in availability? AG.
The seats may already be sold out, perhaps to agents for advance block bookings ?? Seats in J on that route at at that time of year can be like gold dust.
Pros: vast amounts of personal space for work and relaxing. bed is both long and wide. video screen is giant. "ottoman" seat is wide and easily big enough to be a true companion seat at mealtime, unlike the 744 version. the seat massage feature is outstanding, not an afterthought like some.  Cons: Seat controls are a tad complex, can be difficult to get good foot support unless nearly in bed mode. The F and K seats both access the starboard aisle, so it will carry more traffic and be slightly less private than the A side seats which have an aisle to themselves.
So, I apologize, I searched and looked, searched and looked to no avail.  US CP here, I needed to book a flight from Northeast to San Diego for 5 people, with limited miles. I looked on US, all they had was for 50,000 miles per person, I was looking for 25k per person. USairs site showed NO other airlines flights.  I switched to Continental, and found reward flights on CO and UA, all available on CO site, but when I called the CP desk, they said those flights are only available to use CO miles for this, not US miles. They were unable to accommodate me out of MDT, BWI or PHL. Now I have to drive to IAD for my award travel which sucks.  Is this true?  Also, flying on UA as a US-CP, (*a gold) will I have to pay to check bags?
basically the JP has a better grazing trough than the QP - better bevvies too
Yes - but the "sample" prices don't look very encouraging  I'm a bit worried about CE  If further savings start to be necessary I think BA will take a deep look into CE  Other airlines (BMI, AF and KL) appear to be deserting short haul J
Eurocheats views don't count in my book I'm afraid.
Wasn't there just a huge stink about Delta moving to A-East, now they are moving to D? I thought they had just built a brand new club there as well.
I think you'll get more help on the US forum. Moved.
+ 1. My thoughts exactly.
For example: d uz of txting hs cr8d a trend nt 2 uz capitals wen Bginin sentences   Only amongst the proles.  And let's face it, most of them aren't even fit for use as spare parts.
How surprising that you can search using BA  although with no confirmed dates where there are award seats, you don't really know whether it will show the correct availability - and certainly won't show any additional availability that WP or SG may be entitled to see.
I absolutely adore BC, Vancouver and Whistler.  The drive from Vancouver along the coast heading towards Whistler has to be one of teh best anywhere, and Vancouver itself is such a liveable city.  Incidentaly, I managed to set a benchmark for the men's downhill last year whilst skiing in Whistler. They're going to have to work very heard to beat my time of 45 minutes ;-)
Speaking of celebs, my FA on a Dash-8 flight yesterday told me she once had Manute Bol on one of her flights. Can you imagine that guy on a Dash-8?  I can't imagine Manute Bol on any aircraft other than one of the 752's with the extra space in front of the first row of seats in coach on the right that have about 4 feet of legroom in front of them, other than that or International BE, there is nowhere for Manute Bol to put his ridiculously huge legs on a commercial airplane!
Ah, the joys of flying. Hopefully she gets her flights organized eventually. Usually (with my experience), Cathay is quite good on organizing things but of course if everything is full then it might get tough.  For future trips, it might be good idea to get her a PriorityPass. Just for these kind of situations - or is she usually the lucky one who doesn't get into these situations (I am the unlucky one and frequently find myself in these situations so PP has saved me numerous times by providing at least a lounge access).
Rightly or wrongly BA haven't changed their position in that they expect people to pay a reasonable premium to fly with them as opposed to others  a bit arrogant and wishful, but there you have it.  Drop fares, and you'll find it very difficult to put them up again.  Agreed - and I think that rather than drop fares BA prefer to drop capacity  Certainly BA have a very competitive J product, but while 24 months ago only a few carriers carriers flying UK -&gt; US could claim to have an "equal" product now the competition is hotting up  I think that BA is more intererested in maintaining service levels / quality rather than pushing price. Price wars just destroy the airlines although obviously they benfit the customer the in short term
Randall's got very little of my business. When I first got to Houston, they didn't carry beer or wine because of the religous beliefs. Then they decided to, somehow deciding it was OK (ie competition dictated it). Then they were OK for a while, but continuing mismanagement (Tom Thumb purchase was one huge blunder) resulted in the sale to Safeway and a ramp up in prices. In spite of their recent too-little-too-late attempt at price reductions, Randall's (and Safeway) will be gone from the Houston market shortly IMHO. The price differential between Randalls and Kroger/HED could hardly be made up in OP miles. Good riddance.
Does it also track avail for QF partner flights? eg BA.  Have a read of :  and in particular
Thats ok with me. I dont live in GB so dont have a problem with the membership options. BA dont have a problem with taking my dosh either in pounds or Euro!  I know of another girl who doesn't hold your views and opinions in high regard too.  Have the hairbrush scars settled down yet?
I'm sure QANTAS will get around to thinking about this some day. Or maybe they already have, and have rejected it (not many other merchants use SecureCode or the Visa equivalent).  In any case, during the booking process, you are clearly told what the policy is. It seems a bit much to complain about it after you've already agreed to the policy.  QANTAS is a business, not a concierge service. And as a customer, you are free to take your business elsewhere (and complain to QF management). Ranting here does nothing to solve the problem. If enough people complain to QF or take their business elsewhere, then perhaps QF will fix the problem.  But I doubt there are that many people booking ex-PVG flights from other countries.
Thanks for the read Aus Mal I knew there was a reason I didn't buy it. Too long ago to remember.
I was on AA website not too long ago. Looks like you can get AA mile for spending at Randall's. It is discountinued as well.
It's been a bit of reshuffling for DL at PHL. But now they have found a home in D.  PHL Gate Update (2/4)  DL Moving to D?  The word is that the DL club won't be ready for a little while, though. Not sure what will become of the abandoned DL club in A-East, though. I think it'd be great if AA moved behind security into it, but a lot of people seem to like it where it is.
Perhaps QF's approach to CC security from South America is to have phone operators handle the transaction - at a penalty to everyone (but that's another thread!).
If you mean that the same redemption on AA would have cost less, then yes, it is not the best value out there. But, it is moot because those waiting for the window to open for AA point redemptions would have been disappointed since the QF FF redemptions would have got in first at the 355 day window. (Speaking from personal experience). Of course, I am assuming that the only redemptions that are available appear at the 355 day window.
I would suggest, that rule 1 of Exceptional Customer Service is - Rules are there to be broken!  Any business which does not apply rule one, will be unable to provide quality customer service. Exceptional customer service resides in a grey area beyond black and white policies: only businesses which empower their front line staff will ever be able to provide this level of service, to their customers.  It is my experience (and on many occasions, and as others have also posted in their experiences) that QF has a general understanding of rule 1!  (Notwithstanding any consistency argument.)
Actually I've OLCIed multiple times in the last couple of months without first presenting my credit card. They'll instead verify your card at the gate.
In this particular case, sticking blindly to 'policy' has not produced a situation where the OP is happy.  The employee may be applying the rules. Good customer service might have seen that employee asking what other steps could have been taken.  Good customer service to me is the service agents CONSISTENTLY applying the rules and ensuring that customers do not start having unrealistic expectations. The rules were correctly applied by the agent; that to me is not bad service; if agents always correctly apply the rules then they have good customer service. To me , bad service is where agents get it wrong and , for example, try to charge fees where no fee is due
The only differences I can tell are:         Slightly more food options (do they have the pancakes at breakfast in the Qantas Club lounge??).        Coffee prepared by a barrista (all day) rather than machine coffee.        Generally less crowded, but not always the case.        Very helpful service desk staff.   This is based on J lounge visits in BNE, SYD and MEL, so not just specific to SYD lounge,
A landing filmed in slow motion.  The original is    Excellent filming   Really enjoyed it. Thanks.
It is worth knowing, because the thread title is "SYD Terminal 3 QF Lounges".  I would suggest that knowing what you are not entitled to, is just as relevant as knowing what you are entitled to.
Any thoughts? Should I give it a few more days?  Are you really debating this over $1?  Just buy any song! Just make sure to go through the US Airways Shopping Mall portal for credit.
Personal travel - no brainer. Obviously you are going to hunt for the best deal. I just spend so much time booking the flight, the car, the hotel that I can't imagine going to US, then codeshares, then for hotel MR, then HL then for cars Hertz, then Avis. It would drive me crazy.  CPRich, I do like your logic, the downside of course switching over to a direct with no room in F.
The Business Lounge is quieter so you can generally get a seat by the window, get coffee quicker and not have to deal with (as many) drunk yobbos drinking as much beer as they possibly can, however the standard lounge has better views of the runway.
The new (Sept. '09 I think) Jack Duggans is a nice place and a big step up from the old bar just past it. I actually like A East, seems less crowded maost of the time, is DL out completely now?
Unfortunately (at least in this sense), HEB doesn't have a shopper card, so their system would require an overhaul to be able to track your purchases. I love HEB and want this as much as the next person, but I don't foresee it happening anytime soon.  After our $7 purchase last night (and prescriptions that didn't count), I'm now $124 from my next reward guess I won't be trying to get that before the end of the promo.  Same thoughts here. However, Randalls is very convenient for us and they regularly have good sales that make a quick stop for those items worthwhile. But the majority of our packaged groceries (canned food &amp; dry goods) come from Wal-Mart while HEB gets our business for the fresh stuff (meats, fruits &amp; veggies)
Seems a lot more availability on BA than QF!
FYI, on the bottom of my Randalls receipt from last night it stated that their partnership with Continental ($250 spent = 125 miles) will end on 3/1/2010. It wasn't great, but it was something for nothing.
Dave  Thanks. I hadn't read that bit, just saw the part relating to SG which said "Member and 1 guest can access lounge on day of departure. Next onward flight that day must be on a Qantas, British Airways or Jetstar flight number."  Good to know though!
Out of curiosity, if you book through UAL on a US flight, do you still stand to get upgraded if you have US Preferred Status?
But the batty bean-counters in BA's management will never ever blame themselves and their poor decision-making as they drive away lucrative J business. They'll blame the economy, the government, their own staff  Compared with its competitors BA starts with the handicap of LHR. It's crazy to then add extra discouragements for newcomers to change to BA.  Each time, it takes a huge amount of good work from the excellent ground staff and wonderful cabin crew to dispel the horrific images that haunt the collective consciousness of travellers whenever BA is mentioned..  - the luggage mountain on the LHR tarmac - being forcibly IDB'ed from your flight at T5 security beacuse there is "only" 35 minutes before the scheduled departure - being unable to select seats together, except by paying Â£120 and then only getting a choice of poorer seats
I am a BA Gold. I always book fully flex Bus tickets. Without exception at short notice. Lots of other people have to do the same. I dont think I have ever booked a discount restricted ticket. BA, a private company, for sound business reasons, keep a portion of the aircraft available for just this type of passenger. The money they make from us makes it worthwhile to fly the aircraft.  As was said earlier, life is not fair - learn to live with it. This is a contract if you get the early offer of a cheap seat you are being offered a CW seat in a particular part of the aircraft at a particular price. In contract law that is offer and acceptance. If you want to buy a different seat then the offer will be different ie a higher price. You can take it and get your pick, but the lower discount price gets you a restricted choice.  They are not going to release those valuable seats to all and sundry until the last minute and miss the chance of me buying one at full whack at possibly 3 times what the discount purchaser has paid. When I have to buy a business seat at less than T-24 I dread seeing what is left after the holidaymakers have had their fill!!  Well this is the current policy ..been around for a few months now  must be due for an enhancement
OK. CO have retimed the IAH-LHR departure of CO4 that I'm booked on.  This takes my 'barely legal' 45 minute connection down to a positively crazy 25 minutes.  Will CO pick this up and contact me to re-book, or is it down to me to take the initiative?  Problem is, if I miss CO4 i'll presumably end up having to spend an extra night in the US before I can get home.  Thoughts welcome!
Which is completely irrelevant to swordfish210 so what is the point in mentioning it? Anyone who has CL membership will already know of the existence of the facility.
That's a bummer for me. I averaged at least 125 a month if not more,and lately with more family and friends having my card number I was up to two hits a month. Bummer for me , I'll miss getting about 2.5k miles a year for doing nothing.  Ciao,
Thanks everyone for a completely nerd-fest thread which takes the mind off imminent strike issues. Great youtube links. Flyertalk does sometimes redeem itself.
Of course it doesn't help that you can't select SCL or EZE from the QF FF award web pages.
Well, shoot. I have a Safeway within walking distance, so they will still be the logical choice, but it was nice getting miles.  With the Safeway/UA GroceryMiles program, this has been ongoing for more than 10 years. Sad to see it go.
And they're good scones too
There are actually three QF lounges at SYD T3, the 3rd is accessed by membership/invitation only, it is called The Chairman's Lounge.
Dave  Agreed - it should be a # rather than a +
Hiddy, my dear man, I have so many gold cards and know my way round the lounges such that young people think I live there. I spend half the year in hotels and the reception staff in some of them greet me with more familiarity than Mrs Antichef.  London Airways dont fly from my country in any event, and my travel budget often touches Â£10k per month. Is it any wonder some revenue management people want to get a share of it?  Eurocheat? Moi?
So has Qantas stuffed up the data in this table?  I'll go with yes. I think that they meant to put a hash symbol rather than a plus for the gold member ; either that or they have changed the membership terms recently
HarryHV has a good point. i was called today by a colleague who wanted to fly from the UK to Miami on hols in business class.  I told him to start from AMS. he could not believe the difference in price. when i told him there was a bonus for starting in continental europe of a free upgrade to F one way he was astonished.  As he does not live in GB and would have to fly either to LHR or AMS to start the journey - what fool would start from LHR!  Obviously I only know this valuable info because of years of experience on FT
Well that's lame. I did enjoy it as a something for nothing sort of deal. I think I'm like $15 away from another 125 miles so I suppose two six packs are in my future.
WT+ and WT exist. Anyone know why (NAS is the same, as its the same flight) thanks Joejet  Fares are only available something like 353 days in advance on BA which might account for some days in January next year.
I will soon be travelling on QF domestic flight from SYD flying business class, thus I get lounge access in Terminal 3. There are two - the Qantas Club and the Business Domestic Lounge. Which one should I go to, which has more facilities and which one would have a better view of aircraft activity around the airport?
It's actually never happened to me - but I almost only travel with Star Alliance and probably have been lucky. She's really not enjoying herself at the moment. I started a separate thread since this hasn't much to do with SK: Mrs stuck in HKG with C-ticket and terrible AY/CX handling agent
My son's US Air account is set to expire at the end of the month, so I went to itunes to buy a $1 song to extend his expiration. I didn't see anything I really wanted, so I figured I would donate $5 to redcross instead. Now it's been a week, but no miles have posted and I'm starting to wonder if this will work.  Any thoughts? Should I give it a few more days?
It is also moot for those of us that don't have AA points. Living in Australia, it is much easier to earn QF points than AAI do know you can earn AA points living in Oz eg via DC, Amex etc
For me and my circumstances, it is "not bad".
Take essentials in a carry-on as if you have checked luggage I wonder if it will make the connection time too. Better still, just take carry-on if at all possible. Hope it works out.
GCM NAS and KIN have no dates in Club but go to 12 Jan in WT+ and WT    I just get this:  Error We have not been able to find any available seats for the itinerary you requested.  The most common reasons for this are:  You may have requested a route at a time of the year when we don't fly it - although that route may operate at other times.  We may not fly at all on part or all of the routes that you have chosen.  Your requested itinerary may only be possible with more than six separate flights. Unfortunately ba.com can only book journeys with a maximum of six flights. What you can do:  Search again with different dates or departure and arrival points  View our route maps (link to )  View our flight timetables (link to )  Contact us (link to )
Good to know though!  That relates to lounge access for those wanting to access the lounge as a paid Qantas Club member ; With OW status then lounge access rights are wider
Safeway has a huge, and so far succesful push into EDLP, so good bye miles. The new price format will save you enough to buy your own ticketTom Thumb has done a great job in the last six months in Dallas.
Choose one of the Pacific Islands NZ flies to--PPT, RAR, NAN and take a stopover in AKL. Or go to Australia.
are there hoards of mosquitos? Canadian Mozzies seem to have a bigger bite
I think awards to Syd-Eze, Eze-Syd are available but you need to book well in advance, esp. in peak travelling season! I booked a Premium economy return award for my SO in July last year for travel in March 2010 (ie 8 months in advance); subsequently, 3 months later when I accumulated sufficient points, and a J award became available, I paid the 2500 point penalty, and changed it to a J return award.  Last week when I found out that Syd-Eze-Syd is only being sold in 3 classes in a 4 class configured plane, I managed to select a seat in the F cabin. Not bad for 192000 QF points + $300 odd in taxes / surcharges
Not looking great, sat on the ground here, should have taken off at 23:45 but the plane was too heavy to land at Lagos so some cargo has benn off loaded, engines not started yet. I'm getting the muchies after all champoo.  Sorry B747-437B but I don' get enough miles with you to go to LAX in June
Paying for his own ticket no doubt.  Such an old cynic
HIDDY you make me laugh - you often say what I'm thinking
What on earth is one of BAs elite passengers doing in Y?   Paying for his own ticket no doubt.
One of his shifted seats was 16C though, which is definitely not a bassinet and is easily the best seat in Y in the 3 class 777 if one doesn't mind an aisle seat.  Unless the bassinet baby came with a large family who have been put in 2 rows - even that's still poor from BA
Well it's well known that if you choose bassinet seats there is every likelihood that you can be shifted.  You have no need to show the DYKIAG attitude.
And unless I am much mistaken, pretty much anyone can be shifted for an infant. It is the risk of choosing bulkhead seats
Of course if you have been switched for a family requiring the bassinet, then both the parents could be GCHs "bringing substantial revenue to the company"
Call BAEC in USA Tel: 1 800 452 1201 if you use skype its free, they can normally access bookings and help out.
Seems reasonable that these are bassinet seats and the OP was shifted due to babies needed those seats.  I don't think BA is pissing off BA Golds on purpose. Seems to be an operational decision. However, if it was me, I would check out the people now occupying my original seat. If not carrying an infant, I would raise hell and loudly complain after the trip.
Anfield is welcoming you to FT (FlyerTalk), not ET  Welcome to FT from me, too!  You have my sympathy about seat shifting, regardless of the reason. Whether the reason is a reasonable one or not, being seat shifted is still annoying.  I would suggest having a look at the passengers in your old seat, and if there is no infant involved, I would suggest complaining about the seat shifting to BA.
I look at the seat map, but it does not explain 16C. I assume you are hinting that families travelling with babys would have priority to these seats. I am just surprised having travelled on the same Boeing 777 so many times, with the exact same allocation, and with several families with infants on-board, that this has never happened to me.  I do not want come across as being insensitive, but I will ask the question anyway. I think it is also implied by "randomflyer", given the new ridiculous seating policy on BA. Who carries the most weight? The frequent traveller bringing substantial revenue to the company, or a family on an occasional flight? I fully understand that a family travelling with infants has certain needs, but to be allocated a middle seat on a cramped 11 hour flight is not very creative
I think Anfield is welcoming you to FT (FlyerTalk), not ET (EuroTraveller, or a strange visitor from another planet, depending on your humour)  I'll add another welcome
Dear Anfield: Thanks for your advice! Sure, you point about calling the airline is a valid one, but they do not pick up on Saturday evenings! If they had, I would have called them straight away!
That's why I have the PP Amex though
I'm not sure CLT ever lost all 757/767 time, especially what's considered domestic for crew scheduling (Caribbean/Mexico). However, just because a flight operates from one base doesn't mean the crews from that base fly it. There were many times that I would leave CLT at the start of a trip, return to CLT at the end of the 4th day, and not see CLT in between.
I haven't done CLT-GIG myself, but when I was flying ORD-CLT on UA we were delayed and it was going to affect at least 7 people connecting to GIG so I'd say it's more than just PHL traffic, but with any CLT flight it's more connectors than O/D.
Jim  LOL, I knew I was misunderstandung, but glad to have clarification. Also glad to learn all CLT flights are CLT crewswhen did the CLT crews receive finalized training on the 762? And is this a chance to speculate on any other service for this flight?? Did CLT crews not operate the CLT-SJU and CLT-CUN segments as well? Or were those done by PHL crews?
No, 19:50 pay hours.
All the CLT international flights are now CLT crews. This is also true for CDG and the upcoming FCO service.  -Kinglobjaw
InterestingDL runs these trips with the same crewthey work it downsleep all day (supposedly) and then work the same aircraft back at night. So, US is overnighting the crews for two full days? Nice! And when you say 1950, what do you mean? $1,950  Thanks everyone for contributing to this thread, we hope this flight can stay alive and well! Is it operating with PHL crews the way CLT-CDG used to be or is it all CLT crews now?

WT+ has seven inches extra legroom, but the major difference for me is not just the seat and the legroom but also the sense of not being packed in like sardines in WT+. Once you settle in and go for a stroll you immediately notice the difference between the two cabins; one is smaller and quieter, the other is much larger, tends somehow to always feel lit up like a football field, with gnashing of teeth, arms thrashing and so on. Alot of this is purely psychological of course, but then we are emotional and not purely rational creatures.  LHR-JNB is operated by a 744, but some flights are hi-J and some are mid-J (well, now low-J); on the latter, the WT+ cabin is between Club and First, which has certain advantages, but the former configuration has better seat choice in WT+ I think.
anyone have info about seat pitch on wt+ versus wt on us-lhr-jnb flightsthanks..
It's a total boy's club on the right side of the mechitzah.  My shul has egalitarian minyanim! And a woman rabbi.
LOL But let's start with baby steps: First let me into the minyan. Then I'll worry about whether or not I get to wear tefillin.  It's a total boy's club on the right side of the mechitzah.
Many non-Orthodox Jews, and some Jewish women, also use Tefillin during the morning/weekday prayers.    Fight for your right to use Tefillin!
living under a rock for quite some time. Orthodox Judaism is not exactly a rarity or a low-profile item even in the wilds outside New York.  Ya'll com to my part of Texas, got plenty of Baptists and Lutherans, not many Orthodox anythings.
tb  I'm getting Make Flying Fun Again the NZ ad
And all these adds about 'getting help raising your children!' are indeed becoming annoying.  I'm getting mostly ski and stay adswhat does that say about me?! and my parenting skills?
Good morning!  By the way: I love kids! That is why I even bother to teach them something. As said before, the kid and I had a nice (!) talk afterwards.  Furthermore I have been known to address/correct/restrain drunks, obnoxious men bothering women and other mature pests as well. My physique makes that a little easier for me than for most.  So, after a good night's sleep I stand by my correction itself but I do apologize for trying to juice it up for the pleasure of the readers. It really became Katrina in a teacup.  And all these adds about 'getting help raising your children!' are indeed becoming annoying.
Oh now that would be fun to watch
Coming to the fray a little late herebut having seen the whole 'gale in a teapcup' develop, here are a few observations (and sorry for long post in advance):  * partisan lines seem to be preserved a la the BA Board. There are those who (although they 'love children really' and 'were well brought up themselves') constantly attack children in every thread that comes up with boring regularity, and unfortunately, the OP seems guilty as charged here also.  * some parents are very (passive-) aggressive. Being a relatively new parent myself, I can understand some of this, although as yet I don't sympathise. As others have said, raising children is very hard work. Sometimes they are well-behaved, and one takes all the credit. At other times, be it due to teething/illness/ being badly brought up, they are a nightmare, and then we blame anyone else we can think of.  I'm not sure about others, but I can say that the single biggest fear that my wife and I have is about how we raise our daighter. We hope we are good parents. She's too young to know much about right or wrong, but we hope that through love and kindness and discipline, she will grow up to make good choices. However, I lay awake at night worrying about even small decisions. And perhaps it is this fear that is wrongly being channelled into threats on this boardwe parents fear that actually, we did do a bad job, and that it was our fault that henkybaby was upset in the lounge.  * at 10, children are already capable of moral choices, so I sympathise with the OP that he was upset in the lounge, and the boys did/do require discipline. But let's put this in perspective: it was for a short while in some public place, and unless the OP has led a very charmed life, it won't have been the first time some member of the public (usually adults) have been irritating.  * However, is it the OP's place to discipline someone else's child, and with a physical response at that? The answer imo, is an emphatic no. It is irrelevant how violent the response was. It was predetermined, and without doubt, had at least some small malicious intent. I accidentally 'elbowed' my infant daughter the other day when I turned round suddenly. She wasn't badly hurt, and with a quick hug was distracted. and forgot all about it. However, if I, or a complete stranger had done the same with intent, would I be boasting about it? I'm not a lawyer, and not a Thai lawyer at that, but my understanding is that the OP's actions could be interpreted in UK law as common assault.  * As a corollary: if the OP's very irritating gf/partner etc was talking loudly on the phone in said lounge, would I be within my rights (after she had not quietened down with a polite plea) to stride across, grab her phone and smash it against a wall? It would, would it not, teach her a lesson? And no physical harm would be done to her, so it's OK isn't it?   Parents and non-parents alike agree that children require (at times) firm discipline. I think the reality of the scenario was probably rather minor and perhaps even amusing to those that saw it as an accident. But that doesn't disguise the intent of the OP, and I'm not sure that can be condoned.
I think the point that has been made is that staff in TG lounges are anxious not to upset their premium passengers and so therefore complaining to staff ws thought to have little effect.
I booked flight online the other day, and MFU'd LCY-JFK no problems, flying back WT+ from JFK to LHR. Everything in my account (TP Miles etc) show it is WT+ both waysso it can be done. I even got an email from the CWLCY Business Team etc! This was the only flight available to MFU, on a Friday, in Julyand I'm shocked it was available! All I know is the class of service LCY-JFK isn't either a WT+ or CW class, so I assume it is a non-advertised 'ghost' class to allow MFU's!
How was it  -I flew US HNL-CLT 1 week ago. I found the seats to be excellent for sleeping. much betther than anything UA is currently offering out of HNL. -The 2 F cabin crew members were superbly courteous and busy for the full load of 24 pax. When my wife and I ordered the Mai tais ( ), the FA brought us 4 bottles right away and offered to bring more if we desired. -The food service appeared better than domestic F but slightly below Envoy. (I didn't sample it for dietary restrictions and they dont offer special meals even in F on this route ) - There was only one main screen to view movies on (no PTVs) didnt matter much to me as I was primarily interested in sleeping. There are regular outlets beneath each seat should you decide to plug in your own entertainment/laptop. - Only downside I experienced was the cabin temperature was cold and the blanket/pillow was the regular domestic rag and sponge (and there were no extras) I was a little peeved that the FA "couldn't" get me one of the blanket sets from coach "because they are only for coach"  Overall I would choose them again over my regular travel with CO (just I would bring an extra sweatshirt)
Many years ago I flew regularly on AY tin to HEL. In CE they used real bottles for wine, champagne and digestif's and the crew used to wander up and down the aisle and all you had to do was hold your glass out as the crew went past. Saved a lot of waste with those dam fool small bottles.  Maybe that is where I got the habit of selecting an aisle seat!
I was camping out the back of a pub in the interior of Lapland. Nodded off to sleep and was woken by a disturbance going on outside at midnightabout ten of the locals were all knocking hell out of each other - men and women.  I had a Finnish flatmate at uni. Terrifying stuff! He had a reading week - it was one bottle of Â£7 'wodka' after another - he was practically crawling to the off license after a few days. There were quite a few Finns on campus - he was probably the worst but they were all a bit nuts!
Urgh.  I don't know where to weigh in here. Always ET/WT. Grateful for the "free" drink and take it as writ that it's a perk of flying a "full serviced airline". A Bloody Mary at any hour is a civilised drink and I always take notes if the crew says "sorry we don't have any worcestershire sauce back here [at this hour].  Sorry, but if you want a drink, and you're on BA, then go for it. Wheat from the chaff, do you get it? hick
I have done this myself when on nights for 3 years. Working nights turns your day upside down, so a beer with a snack before bed
I'm not a big drinkerI can take it or leave it.  However even I had a couple of glasses of Champagne in F on the GRU-EZE sector at 8 in the morning and thoroughly enjoyed it.
Who are you to determine when is a suitable time for the OP to have an alcoholic drink? Apart from the already mentioned possibility of the OP having transferred from another flight, s/he may have just finished a night shift before heading to the airport in which case it seems like a perfect time for an alcoholic beverage.  As britenbsas says, clearly you havnt ever done regular night shifts, take it from me, iv done them for a straight 6 months, you change your way of living, breakfast at 4pm, lunch 10 or 11pm, home after work, meal and a glass of red, yes its 8am, but why shouldnt i have a glass of wine after the end of my shift? im allowed to when i work a 12 hour day shift
who are you to decide what is good for someone else? As I said before, as long as it doesn't lead to a passenger being disruptive, it has nothing to do with you! I would never ask for alcohol at that time of the morning but it's not up to me to judge people on what they do.
I must have been on a different bus then (and I'm talking DEL, not BOM - sorry for any confusion). At 1A, the bus drops you ouside departures, landside. On the other hand, Kingfisher have now moved to Terminal 1B. Oh well, there go the Kingfisher porters for Indian Airlines customers in 1A
I know there is a sterotype for some people that fly regularly, but isn't this getting a bit too personal a bit too soon?
Once every six months
One other question, at what stage do you apply for the MFU - do you have to confirm the WT+ booking first then call for upgrade or can this all be done at time of booking?
I had noticed that recently with the bad weather over Christmas. I will still have my BMI gold until at least July 2011 so if flight cancelled I'll be right over to the BMI counter for assistance. I assume I will be offered a full refund on my non flex BA ticket if flights cancelled?  Only BA lounge in T5? interesting. Suppose that sort of makes sense really. Good to know about the announcements - will need to pay attention on the screens.
Don't think anyone has mentioned this yet but if travelling from LHR, T5 has no boarding announcements from the lounges nor do you have any third party lounges, BA only I'm afraid.    Edited to add: Apologies, just noticed OPebble mentioned the announcement thing earlier. That will teach me to have the page open for a over an hour, going away and then posting without refreshing the page
One thing that may be of consideration is that at the slightest hint of snow / bad weather BA cancels their domestic flights first while BMI more often than not is still flying. I think this is a big factor if you are doing a weekly shuttle.
I'm a virgin to Terminal 5 - I have so much to learn  Thanks for the tips on the hotels, good to know. I used to be platinum with Holiday Inn when I was working in Aylesbury and the Holiday Inn was the only decent hotel. In Edinburgh the Holiday Inn's are a little dated, but if I was going to take my point collection seriously I need to adapt.  To be honest, the hotels are likely to be severely cut as I am looking to buy property back up in Edinburgh so when I arrive for my weekend trips, I'll have to make my own bed!  If only I didn't watch "Up in the air" last weekend - I promised to change my ways as I didn't like what the future held  Prices for the WT+ to JFK look interesting especially the MFU to Club - will look into this sale right away.  Thanks again everyone - and looking forward to bumbing into you at somepoint on my travels.  Not to sure about all the shuttle and prive in jokes's with BBB - but I'm sure this will all become clear in time
Note that BA do not make boarding announcements in the LHR lounges - you have to watch the Flight Information screens.
for some reason    To answer the point about hotels, hilton does earn miles.  another fine way of earning miles from hotels would be to switch to IHG hotels and make use of the priority club. There is an offer on the first page of the tesco thread for 25000 pc points which along with the other bonus points offers for stays etc would add up to around 40k points on your first stay at holiday inn, crowne plaza, holiday inn express etc etc etc! the pc points transfer over to ba miles at 2000 ba miles per 10000 pc points.  As for the LCY flights, there is 1 more E170's due to arrive and be in service prior to the end of march 2010.  There is also 5 E190 aircraft due, with them starting to arrive in March this year, the new E jets will mean the total retirement of the RJ fleet from BA. BA do also hold 3 further options for the E190 which i would expect to see them realise fairly soon as the Ejets seem to be a hit with the customers.
Unless an emergency (as mentioned with other example) I would see whether you cannot travel with your wife. I mentioned this thread to my wife as maybe it makes her appreciate even more all the extra trips I am doing to help with the kids  On lap will be difficult, but indeed during take off and landing (and turbulence) required.
as has allready been said you can but a seat but when the seat belt signs go on the little one will have too be strapped into the extenstion belt,  forward facing 5 ponit harness with single release car seat can be used for babys 6 months to 3 years, which it can stay strapped into for the whole of the flight
Mrs NM flew MEl-AKL on NZ (in J on upper deck of 744) when six months pregnant and with 19 month-old Mini NM#1. She found the only problem was during the meal service, trying to balance Mini + meal tray. Crew were really good an staggered Mini and Mrs meals.  This was quite some time ago  way back when it was possible to redeem QF FF points for NZ operated flights. I guess the fact that Mini NM#1 now has his drivers licence indicates how long ago it was .
Problem is, with a large-ish bump, and a struggling toddler, the prospect of a lap strap is not great. If we get a second seat, what are the rules for the toddler - what do BA provide?  My wife (at 5 months pregnant), flew SH over Christmas with our 14 month old on her own as I was stuck away during the bad weather. We bought an extra seat for our toddler, as that was easier although not the cheapest solution. The rules as far as I know were fine with the toddler being in the seat during the flight, but whenever the seatbelt signs were on, my wife had to use an extension belt and put the toddler on her lap. I think the cutoff is 2 yrs old when they are allowed to stay in their own seat, but I'm not sure.
We took the (forward facing) car seat the last time this happened, agreed it was a pain to get to the gate however Mrs Allthebestnameshavegone said she wouldn't travel without it (on her own or even with me) again   Edited to add, little un slept for the whole of the flight (and every one she took there after, just as in the car)  Edited (AGAIN) to add, we had to pay for the seat as per IanMKT6, however baby was allowed to remain in her forward facing car seat and not on my wifes lap.
mrs astral clouds will be about 6 months pregnant when she flies without me short haul in a couple of months. She will also be with our 16-month old son.  Problem is, with a large-ish bump, and a struggling toddler, the prospect of a lap strap is not great. If we get a second seat, what are the rules for the toddler - what do BA provide?
You can get the Hawaiian flight credited to the AA program because it is code-share but not to another OW program
I'm afraid not. The flight must be operated by a oneworld carrier to get
Do I earn TPs for an AA/HA codeshare - AA flight number, HA metal - booked as part of a larger AA booking: LAX-HNL-KOA(on HA)-LAX  I've had a look through T&amp;Cs and can't find the answer.  Thanks.
They delivered my bags at 11:45pm  Even worse, a call to BA customer relations passed all responsibility to RICO and said there was nothing they could do. I hadn't been the worst "complainer" that day - some poor soul had got their bag at 2:40am
Once when my luggage didn't make it on my plane due to a short connection time (Orlando - Denver - San Jose) they called me from SJC to say they had it (this was 1pm) and it could be delivered any time up unto 2am as they wait until almost the last flight has arrived so they can load it on a truck and deliver it all in one go. As the airport was 10 mins away I just went and got it myself. And you should have seen the rest of the luggage that was lost. Wherever possible I have allowed for longer connection times or gone for carry-on only since that time.
Delivered 1:21 this Sunday.  They seriously delivered it at 1:21am? That's a bit rude, although they get top marks for effort to be working that late!
Glad you got yours !  Having had luggage lost quite a few times in the past, I know it can be a painful experience.  I can only speak for Hamburg(Ger) and NYC, there the BA are using lowest-bidder courier companies, and do not have any staff in their lost-baggage 'department' you can talk to after you have left the airport - unless you count voicemail.  Lost luggage is a big deal for anyone, but BA , I feel save to claim after 20+ pieces lost in the past few years .
If Rico have your bag they are doing everything they can to get it delivered to you..  The numbers are dwindling but now its the bottom of the pile.. the details are not good.. People are moving onto different address's etc ..  The baggage e-mails are being systematically worked through to gather info on each bag so to help find your bag keep the e-mail breif and easy to work through..  Airline Ref No (In the subject box) Name Adress given to the airline Change of delivery address Brief discription of the bag.. Contact numbers  Try to arrange for as many neighbours as possible to take the bag if some one attempts delivery, it's a must  Heathrow Bags only    The bags they have are safe and will get delivered if at all possible..  But If Rico say they definatly dont have the bag then they dont have it ..  Other contractors muct have been used for that volume of bags..     Good Luck All  Let me know if it helps..
Just got it!  Delivered 1:21 this Sunday.
'World Traveller' is Economy, and 'World Traveller Plus' is Premium Economy.
I take it that PCPM would be the same as a full mileage redemption in that you would get no miles and no tier points.
Do the redemption requirements change often?
Ah! Was wondering whether that would be the case as it is down as 2 transactions on the statement. It is just a booking for myself and my fiancee done at the same time so seems a little odd they are down as 2 transactions. Oh well, not to worry. Thanks for the reply.
In terms of bad taste and judgement, the nadir was BASSA's use of war analogies in its official member communications, specifically using an edited photograph of Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima from World War II and making references to The Holocaust, quoting the "First They Came" poem that was attributed to Martin NiemÃ¶ller.
The etymology is hardly the issue. The fact is the term is used pejoratively and is intended to vilify those to whom it is applied.  I am unable to understand this statement within the context of your post.  In written communication?! I doubt it.
In official publications? BASSA used that wording, as well as much else, in an official release to their members denigrating BALPA and flight crew. It's so unprofessional it beggars belief. No wonder BALPA are looking at suing them.
Rather unprofessional, really. Feeling passionate about something is one thing, being unprofessional about it is totally another.  I do not think it would do BA cabin crew as a whole any justice that their union is behaving so unprofessionally as using those expressions in publicly available written materials. It's not just the 'words' either - the way those materials were written has been far from professional and quite inappropriate, especially if they are trying to gain support and sympathy, in my view.
First, I do see how actually circumscribed labor action is in the UK in the links in the post of yours that I picked up. Certainly a much more mature (meaning codified) system than in the US. Second, as I said, the aim of CHAOS is to limn the line, be ephemeral, and leave people affected, wondering, but unable to put their hands on it (or their luggage?). Referring to the first point, one would certainly anticipate that if it were ever more than this, there would be a new law about it. And third, it may well have happened to BA in December. I think it did, albeit barely distinguishable from the snow. Has there been disciplinary action? (Question is not just to McG.)
All Trades Unions use the term "scab" - it refers to a wound and how scabs cluster to stop the blood flow and heal the wound.  The term "blackleg" was first used at a miner's strike in Northumbria. Raising the trouserleg to show clean legs proved that you had stayed on strike and not gone to work. A "scab", when he raised his trouserleg, would show a coal-dust covered "black leg" which inspired the song "The Blackleg Miner".  Today, thee is a basic ignorance of British history and cultural heritage which costs British businesses dearly in erroreous harassment, bullying and victimisation claims.  "Foxtrot Oscar", from the phonetic alphabet, is a pretty obvious euphemism and a damned sight better than using the real version - which most company managers use frequently!
Just because the information was available there it doesn't mean that's where it's being taken from
Well it won't be for the want of trying.
You two should really hook up and sort this curiosity out
People haven't listened to any suggestion that there are other tactics available, between "strike" and "no strike". At least some in this mostly closed discussion are recognizing that such exist.  Firewind, I don't think that UK employment law allows for crew to operate a CHAOS strategy like they do in the US. I believe that this would be classed as unofficial strike action, leaving those who partake liable to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.
There are two.
KLM's 777-300 has 5 rows of 2-3-2 configuration. The cabin is cramped and the seat while lie flat is boxed in. The screen is the only redeeming feature. Getting row 1 would make flying this aircraft OK. KLM have made a mistake putting 5 rows into the space available. If they had only put 4 rows in they would have a very superior productbut alas KLM isn't that clever.
Upstairs is Schengen. Downstairs is non-Schengen.  The following applies at AMS: * Schengen to Schengen: no passport check, no security check * Non-Schengen to Non-Schengen: no passport check# , security check at gate of departing flight * Schengen to Non-Schengen: passport check at the central checkpoint, security check at the gate of departing flight * Non-Schengen to Schengen: passport check and security check at the central checkpoint between these two areas  # there may be a random passport check upon exiting from your arriving
If you are transferring international-to-international (non-Schengen) you don't have to go through passport control.  D Pier is a bit of an odd one - downstairs is non-Schengen and upstairs is Schengen. D49 is downstairs - I think upstairs starts at someting like D58.
I'm sure there's a copy in my late father's library, so I have no excuse for not taking your advice. After I'm done with Landscape and Memory, though.
Johan  Well, the real Sinterklaas comes to Hong Kong every year all the way from Spain (or is it Turkey?). However, I heard he flew with Cathay because they have better service.   and for those who would like to know more about Dutch culture, I recommend the short story "Six to Eight Black Men" by David Sedaris (from his book called "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim")
Well, when I was a kid in Warsaw, it fell to my dad (i.e. KLM) to host the annual "nieuwe haring" party. On the other hand, the Dutch ambassador not only dressed up as Sinterklaas every year (his secretary made a very passable Zwarte Piet), he also invited the Indonesian kids to his residence on Sinterklaasavond.  The opinions of Dutch expats:  Nederlanders willen meer service van ambassades (Of course they willen dat. Don't we all willen more service from iedereen?)  Verlenen Nederlandse ambassades wel voldoende service?
To get an insight into how expats feel about the Dutch, see this interesting discussion on whether Dutch are direct or plain rude.  Talking about etiquette: always play the ball, not the player. Marks off for you.  I have just completed a survey amongst 15000 employees of our company worldwide in which cultural cooperation was the most important subject., You are right that the Dutch consider themselves to be direct and open and most other cultures consider that same behavior to be blunt and impolite. It surprised me that the Dutch came out as one of the least pleasant cultures to work with, after the French and the Germans. However, their ambivalence was a greater objection than their directness.  I still think SIRE is a useless organization and that site lacks context and merit. I do agree that Dutch society has become less open and friendly and I fear the rise of people like Geert Wilders.  However I find that the boys and girls in blue are one of the best cabin crews out there. They are genuine. The only reason I am sorry to change from KL/AF to BA is the crew. They are a breath of fresh air.
to understand dutch culture and a historical background on it, i suggest reading The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age by Simon Schama
Just to add a dissonant voice to the chorus:  On the assumption that you are traveling alone, and that you intend to get some sleep during the flight, I would recommend 1E or F. You will have aisle access; and so will your neighbor, who will therefore not have to crawl, climb, leap or jump over you when leaving his seat.  On daytime flights that are not mainly over water, I prefer 1A or J, simply because I at times still enjoy old-fashioned nose-pressed-to-the-window IFE.
OK thanks!! indeed, always hard to choose between noone in front or noone behind! both sound tempting!!
VIP card is same color etc like basic but with small "VIP" word below Baltic Miles, and have expiration date at the bottom.  I also got my VIP card. No upgrade vouchers for the comped VIP though. I wonder whether say send vouchers when I will fly have enough miles/flights for the VIP.
Last time I was at CGK it took 40 minutes just to get through the Swine Flu scans. The transfer desk was not available so you had to go landside which required to buy a visa, required to pay airport departure tax and then security again. The entire procedure took more than one hour with hand luggage only.
We went downstairs to Mexicana's lounge and were told we would not have access there unless Mexicana gave us a little card which stated we have acess to their lounge.  So, in the end we were not able to access either lounge, and it was getting late, so we just went to the gate. Mexicana's Employees just don't seem to know exactly what they are doing.  In Mexico City we had no problem accessing the lounge.  This is awful! When people do online check-in they have no access to the invitation card from agents. Does this mean that premium pax would then have no lounge access at all? It makes no sense that MX pax cannot access the OneWorld lounge. Is this still the case?
OK. But my questions wasn't AA specific but a general OW one.
Questions about AA awards are best answered on the AA forum. 99% of questions on AA awards get moved to the AA forum
Thanks for the responses. It is what I expected but thought it was worth asking if there were any loopholes/strategies.  Thanks again.
For a 3 day stopover there is zero chance of through checking bags.  Some airports have luggage storage facilities (for a fee).
My thought is when does a connection turn into a stopover. For example if I was flying immediately onto LIS from MAD my luggage would be checked all the way through. Works for a 3 hour connection, a 6 hour connectionuntil how many hours.  Again, I'm more than likely to just check my big bag at the airport, I was just curious if anyone managed to convince a airline that a 72 hour period was really a "just a connection". Seems unlikely, then again so do lots of things involving travel.  Thanks  A connection is less than 24 hours, more than that is a stopover. There is no room for negotiation, this is a very standard rule which is enforced by all airline. It not only has implications for baggage, but also for taxes, fees and other things. However, some airports don't allow baggage through check for overnight connections so even if it only is an 8 hour connection through checking might not be possible. Most airports however allow this.
It is a AA OW award (although I'm not sure why it would make a difference).  My thought is when does a connection turn into a stopover. For example if I was flying immediately onto LIS from MAD my luggage would be checked all the way through. Works for a 3 hour connection, a 6 hour connectionuntil how many hours.

Well they still sent me my nice shiny new EXP card.  Thanks for the link that I could not find.
Um..
AA has the 4 flight requirement on its own metal for elite status similar to BA, but reports are it is not enforced as rigidly as in BA.  I made EXP last year with zero AA flights (metal or flight number). All flights were QF, CX, JL and one BA. I cannot see anything in the AAdvantage terms and conditions that suggests there is a 4-flight requirement. All references to status only reference thresholds for flown segments, qualifying points and qualifying miles. Of course they have the right to change those requirements in the future.
Midlevels, do you have any thoughts on the best Hotel program for the APAC regions?  I am about to move to BKK (from the UK) to a job that will need lots of travel to SYD, NRT, SIN, INC and PVG. I am currently SPG plat but there seems to be a lack of choice from SPG in those cities so thinking about switching elsewhere. Any thoughts?  Accor is ok in terms of selection (but poor in recognizing status) and maybe even consider Hyatt. They'll match to Diamond from SPG Gold sometimes with a good selection in those areas you specified.
Actually, flying Air Koryo is something I've wanted to do for years. Our very own Swanhunter (thanks for moving the thread BTW) posted a trip report and lived to tell the tale. Granted though it was an Ilusyhin and not a Tuoplev.
No you wouldn't Really!
Done!  Swanhunter Mod BAEC
AA has the 4 flight requirement on its own metal for elite status similar to BA, but reports are it is not enforced as rigidly as in BA.  Does that include codeshares like the challenge does? AA.com doesn't specifically call out codeshares one way or the other. I could actually manage 4 flights on AA but my intra-US flights are most likely to be SFO-SEA which is operated by AS. Plus I absolutely refuse to travel on a lawn dart, I'd rather travel on an Air Koryo Tupolev than a knackered old MD80.  AA does look like the best option right now. I think I've ruled out MPC because of the quirks of the program. I tend to hoard my miles and then use them for redemptions in F so wouldn't want to fall foul of the expiring miles rule. I'm considering saving up for a RTW F redemption but couldn't find information on AA.com.  Swanhunter - do you think you could move this to the OW forum as I'd like to throw the question out to a wider audience and see what the Oneworlders think. We've really veered out of the BA world now anyway and I know this board has a tradition of embracing the off topic but I don't want to push the envelope.
Agree on AA &gt; BA for crediting miles (note I did not say/imply for anything else! )  AA has the 4 flight requirement on its own metal for elite status similar to BA, but reports are it is not enforced as rigidly as in BA.
Hi,  No problem at all ( I have done it several times).  If you have time ( and arrive before 2pm ) you could also go landside, use the Arrivals lounge ( with the Concorde Breakfast room) then go back airside to the airside concorde room  Regards
No problem to use the CCR. Just show your F inbound boarding pass
I'm sure this is answered in other threads, but if I'm arriving on an incoming flight in First, can I use the CCR and GF lounges for the 6 hours I'll be in T5 before travelling on a domestic flight - and to do this I'll need to show my First boarding pass to the lounge staff?
No problem earning LHR-HKG, I almost got to EXP through that route.
In fact it's even less restrictive than that. The restriction only applies to flights to/from the USA, i.e. you CAN earn miles on flights to/from, say, Canada.  From aa.com: "British Airways' transatlantic flights to/from the U.S. are not valid for AAdvantage mileage accrual or redemption."
just tried it with a tenner so will know in a couple of days
Thanks  You're welcome!  And I checked my balance just now and the extra points are there!  Just tossing up whether it's worth getting a mobile from them today or not. Other half needs a new phone and he doesn't use it very much apart from the odd call and a few texts, so a pre-pay will fit the bill. Hopefully I won't be marked down as an excessive shopper as last week I went in and got 4 tesco ink catridges 2 colour, 2 black as I actually did need them and the 500 bonus points each were a nice aside.
I dont think it works. I am sure its been discussed before in the BA AMEX thread? Perhaos the payment initially goes through then is later declined? If it does work however, it will be a blessing for me.
How strange! Won't that be flagged as money laundering?
Flew VAA-HEL and HEL-ARN on friday. And of course HEL-ARN were late. The connections from HEL is almost always late.
I've seen that throughout Europe.  Appropriate handle for this thread, btw.
You can use your BA Amex to top up your Paypal Top up card and earn miles. That we know. Did you also know you can use your Paypal Top up card to pay off your BA Amex card ? Go to your Amex online account and click on 'make a payment' and enter your Paypal Top up card details as if it was a debit card. Might be worth posting this on page 1 as it doesnt mention it there !
Actually the answer is no and no.  Technically if you buy a normal Y fare, you can preassign seats in the PY cabin if there's still seat available. But of course normal Y fare is more expensive than a PY ticket.
We were diverted on flight 859 on the 11th. This added 3 hours to the flight, which meant a midnight arrival. The beverage service was extremely poor, with our section of the plane not being served until 5 hours after we left Seattle. Most of the plane was served enroute to Oakland, but the start of service had been delayed because of rough conditions. When beverage service resumed, the attendants began in the front all over again. I mentioned this to our attendant and she agreed that it was a poor way of doing it, but the older attendant insisted that they had to do it that way.  Our late arrival meant that my car rental company (National) was closed. Fortunately I had called them before we left Seattle and they advised me to go to Alamo if we landed before 1 am. Alamo honored our reservation and rates. I know they are both owned by Enterprise, but I was extremely pleased.  9 hours is too long for anyone to spend on a 737 from Seattle to Hawaii.
Yes, it inevitably depends on the weight of the plane (pax + cargo + fuel). As I mentioned earlier, seems like an awfully thin line but is based on an FAA-approved formula.
There are also AA codes on some domestic AU flights such as CBR-SYD, but they are timed for connections to QF11, 107, 3 and 73 - US bound flights which have AA codes.
I think that's right. The only exception seems to be AA codes on QF flights across the Tasman from SYD to AKL etc - they don't connect from AA metal per se in SYD (but do connect from the AA code-share)
A SYD-NRT flight would likely be covered in the AFA Exception, but without a business reason to be in Asia, it's not likely the the US Government would pay for the ticket.  As a general rule, I don't know of any AA codes on routes that don't (a) immediately connect from, or connect to, an AA-metal flight, and/or (b) begin or end in the USA. Thus there are QF flights carrying AA codes to and from the USA, or CX flights carrying AA codes between HKG and, e.g. BKK where one immediately can get off or on an AA-coded (CX) flight from/to the USA. But a case of, e.g., SYD-BKK, no AA codes, since one can get to BKK on an AA code more directly via NRT or HKG (thus there are AA codes on the relevant CX or JL flights.)  The Circle products allow for open (surface) segments although you have to count the miles. You might ask if you could get away with a self-purchased ticket to, e.g., DPS (around $400 on Jetstar) from which there are AA codes on CX to LAX, SFO, or JFK all via HKG. That would satisfy the North Pacific crossing requirement of the product. Maybe you could time it to have a couple of days in Bali - hard duty.
I thought the same. The QF operated flights between AU and South East Asia/Japan don't have AA codes. Only QF and JL codes on the direct AU-JP flights and QF, BA or JL codes via BKK and SIN.  A SYD-NRT flight would likely be covered in the AFA Exception, but without a business reason to be in Asia, it's not likely the the US Government would pay for the ticket.
I just checked the SYD and MEL airports departures baords for the next three days and the AA codeshares were to AKL, SFO, HNL, LAX.  I thought maybe there might have been an AA codeshare on flights to NRT (AA sells fares to the US via Tokyo in conjunction with Qantas) but there doesn't seem to be any. (I know you want BKK but just I cjecked NRT out of interest.)
2. Could you give a run down of the Fly America Act please. 3. A Business class Circle Pacific (DCIRCx) fare should be a lot less than $12 - $14k. 4. Check out the price of a DCIRCx fare ex BKK (its about half the above price). 5. Even a First Class Circle Pacific fare might come in less than your price above (if you buy it in the right place). 6. I'm not aware of AA codeshares from Oz to SE Asia (unfortunately), but a check on "classavailability" might give a clue.  1. No worries! 2-5. I know it should be, basically the rate we have is a way to legally subsidize the airlines without going through the public eye. 6. That is what I really want to find, looks like UA out of SIN is closest i found.  #6 is the 12k question    EDIT: Gardyloo, I like that you are thinking whole picture. Sadly only place is SYD :-(. I think the only American Code Share flights go back to LAX, SFO or HNL I'll have to play with the flights, and annoy some agents again and report my findings :-)
My question goes out to ask if anyone has done an around the pacific on on one world or *A within the confines of the Fly American Act? IF so, please tell me how you did it. Thanks!  Certainly no expert, but I think I understand  You don't have any business purpose to go somewhere in Asia that would allow you to come home via the North Pacific - which you have to do with the Circle Pacific product. Is your only business stop in SYD? Could you justify a business stop in any city in Asia? If so, there are plenty of AA codeshares from most cities served by CX or JL.  If there was such a justification, then you might have an out  * Travel by non-U.S. carrier would eliminate two (2) or more aircraft changes en route; or * Travel by U.S. carrier would extend the total travel time six (6) hours or more than would travel by non-U.S. carrier. * Short Distance Travel. For all short distance travel, regardless of origin and destination, use of a non-U.S. carrier is permissible if the elapsed travel time on a scheduled flight from origin to destination airport by non-U.S. carrier is three (3) hours or less and service by U.S. carrier would double the travel time.
1. There is no "u" in QANTAS 2. Could you give a run down of the Fly America Act please. 3. A Business class Circle Pacific (DCIRCx) fare should be a lot less than $12 - $14k. 4.

Sorry if its already been posted. I have a question about the Around the Pacific flights and the dreaded Fly America Act which I am bound to.  I am going to Sydney in March for work, and usually buy a AA codeshare flight on quantas for around 12~14k using our "corporate discount". Terrible I think. I am allowed to take different flight/route back if the total cost are less. Last time I flew out to SYD took a flight to BKK at my expense and flew Cathay Pacific back using AA's codeshare.  I just learned about the Around the Pacific Flights and tried my best to learn its rules. Called the AA travel desk and asked if I could get an AA coded flight from Sydney to either BKK to NRT to be compliant with the FA Act. Guy named Mike was really rude and was asking me why I wanted to make it complected, guess I didn't express what I wanted to do well.  My question goes out to ask if anyone has done an around the pacific on on one world or *A within the confines of the Fly American Act? IF so, please tell me how you did it. Thanks!
At Narita I've done points upgrades several times at check-in and got my business class boarding card immediately. I assume it should be enough to get me into the lounge, although I've also got my gold card.
Continental also waves baggage fee for their own silver members. I didn't see a word about other carriers silver members.  and also for other airlines' silver members
we have all heard a ring or two during a climb.  Cell phones do not continuously transmit when inadvertently left on. This produces much less potential interference than with the phone being used during a call.   No, everything is not "ON". How can you even say this?   You are not aware of pilots getting interference?   So? The opposite has happened. See the other threads on the subject in this forum.   Sorry, we generally do not have communications systems around us every day to be able to tell if any one of us can answer your challenge. It is crazy for anyone to demand we answer this.   Only in zero visibility?
Agreed.  Sad to see this go  Won't feel as compelled to shop at Carrs anymore. Freddies and Costco here I come
You should see the thread on the DL forum its like somebody died [or is about to]
oh joy. That will be the day the NW website takes 3 steps back to 1997. DL has one of the lamest sites in the industry. Nobody still holds a stick to the AS site (maybe WN or FL comes the closest but are still pretty far off). But as far as legacy domestic carriers go, DL is one of the worst if not the worst website around
The rumors on the DL board are that the reservations system for NW will be shutdown on 2/1 and the former DL system will handle everything. The rumors also suggest that nwa.com will be shutdown at the same time.
.  Hi,  At least I did not suggest going via FRA to pcik up the LAN flight there! ( for more tier points!)  On IB you will only get the cabin bonus ( 125% of miles) and no silver card mileage bonus.  Another drawdback is that of course the LON-MAD and MAD LON will be on european business class seats ( bit of a let down after the long leg from South america)  Regards
Useful and timely info thanks TBS. Iberia have some good prices to MIA in the summer at the moment. Bit of a pain to go via MAD rather than direct but it is probably worth it for the price + extra TPs.
Except the Cathay Flounge at LHR T3 if you are flying on BA. /rant
I flew this route with Iberia last February.  I was a little worried having read some comments about Iberia crew, but I have to say I had a great time. I think this was helped by the fact that the cabin was nearly empty - but the crew were great.  This was my one and only time in Madrid airport, I did find it massive, and didn't think the lounge was brilliant. But I did like the room where you can go and have a sleep in.  The pre-flight food I didn't think was up to much, and the ambiance in the room was crap.  But everything on board was great, despite a late aircraft change we still got there on time.
PSPS: If you can get the LAN flight from MAD to SCL then LAN to EZE I would consider that also  You were doing great until that last paragraph TBS - The OP would need to be a plane geek to do that.  The MAD-EZE direct will sufficeI would suggest taking the lunchtime day flight on the way over.
Hi,  Yes she will,  40 tps for LHR-MAD and 120 for MAD to EZE.  ( extra 40 tps each way compared to BA unless the trip had a stop over in GRU)  Regards
Hi Sarahuk,  The seats on most of the aircraft are now fully lie flat ( i thnk on the timetables those that are classfied as A345 ( A346 with flat seats) and A342 ( A340 300 series with flat seats) The fleet is due to be fully equipped by March 2010 I think.   With your silver card you can use the BA lounge at LHR T3.  Cabin is 2-2-2 and clean ( looked new) and quite bright.  IFE- on demand but selection ok ( not as good as LAN or maybe BA)  Blanket is provided ( no duvet) but amenity kit is ok ( it has a shoebag also and a comb!)  English is spoken also ( a few words of Spanish helps ie Por Favor and Muchas Gracias).Everybody seems to appreciate if you make the effort to speak the local language. Menus are also in English with and english option on the IFE.  For the late night flight from Madrid a full 3 course dinner is provided in the Velaquez bistro ( far end of the lounge in T4S) and a starter ( on my flight ot SCL leaving at 0010 we had soup and a pasta dish as the starter) and desert is served on board.  A self service bar/trolley was available in the forward galley. Breakfast is quite good ( bread is the hard type though)  Privacy screen in between the seats is small ( should be bigger IMHO) but on my flight there was no one beside me.  Toilets were ok and clean and looked new Regards  TBS  PS on my return from SCL the electronics did not work at all for rows 1-4 ( 5-7 were ok)so the seats did not recline at all.  I am writing into IB.  We were also delayed coming into SCL so I would have missed the connecting flight to LHR- IB had staff at the top of the gate with new boarding passes for the next flight ( 1 hour later) with no need to go to a service desk ( very good) and bags made it also.  The lounge in madrid is pretty good with a quiet area ( terminal is long though)  Overall pretty good ( not as good as BA CW but given the price difference is not bad VFM)   PSPS: If you can get the LAN flight from MAD to SCL then LAN to EZE I would consider that also ( if you can afford the extra time). LAN in business was excellent ( flat seats, a soft comfortable duvet and a AVOD with 600+CDs -en route from FRA-MAD and SCL-IPC I just listened to the CDs and did not watch the movies)
I also wanted to book a NW flight today, and there are none available as they switch to the DL reservation system. The agent on the phone said I needed to wait two days to book any NW flights as they change them to DL numbers. I wonder how much revenue they are losing with the NW flights being off the market for so long.  Lets hope when the systems merge, its not like HP &amp; US
I had a PNR with AS, DL and NW. AS gave separate confirmation numbers for DL and NW. Yesterday, the NW number redirects to a DL page, but has incorrect flight info. Tonight, AS is unable to confirm my NW segments and DL is unable to retrieve my reservation to give me seat assignments.  I also wanted to book a NW flight today, and there are none available as they switch to the DL reservation system. The agent on the phone said I needed to wait two days to book any NW flights as they change them to DL numbers. I wonder how much revenue they are losing with the NW flights being off the market for so long.
I just checked the itineray I booked on NWA.com and it directed me to delta.com. It looks like the flight numbers changed to DL #'s but I still have my exit row seats so I'm good.  My flight is on Feb 8th so I probably won't fall through the crack and get a UG like some MVPG's have received but exit row is better than the typical Y seat.
Yeah I dont know Ive had the same ordeal. Ive decided Im avoiding DL until they can pull their head out of their back sides. Its just one problem after another with them lately. Im surely no AA fan but as of late they are way easier to deal with than this DL debacle
Well, DL seems to have changed all flights to their code from 2/1/10. In looking at My Trips, all of the flights that were booked on NW or DL tickets have been updated under the My Trips tab on alaskaair.com, however all of the tickets booked on AS codes get the red "schedule change" of death message. My question here is when will AS find a better way to automate the schedule change process? Both DL and NW make it fairly easy, but we always have to call AS. Anything coming to make it easier because I have 5 or 6 reservations that get only the red message of death?
So my fiance just booked 2 award tickets to go to Atlanta next weekend using her miles on Alaskaair.com. I'm a MVP and she's just a regular member, I put our mileage numbers into our PNR on Delta.com, do I call Delta reservations to try and get our seats changed to something better than what we have now?
Yes, call the partner desk. DL and AA don't fly to KUL, and they are the only partners you can search online. You'd need to fly CX or KE (theoretically, you could fly KL, but it looks like AS doesn't let you do "wrong way" awards that would route you through AMS).
I read the article on Malaysia in this mths Alaska Airlines in-flight magazine and tried to see if I can use my miles to book a flight to KL..but when I tried, for various dates, (all the way to next Dec)..I was prompted with: We located a flight or flights that matched your request, but all seats are full.  Try selecting a different date.  Code: -1300   Is there a way to find availabilty
I would rather choose see half the world than 30k miles on my account for 700gbp  So would I part of the time.  However, it is NOT a MR. Vacations/Leisure trips are great - and many of us prefer them over MRs. Lets remember what mileage runs are though.  The OPs fare has no/little MR potential.
Is that safe?
Keep in mind that one can only upgrade on AA metal, so in my example, you needn't worry about upgrading MAD-FRA or FRA-LHR.
LHR-ORD-ATL-ORD-JFK-MAD-FRA-LHR, $559  How expensive are the taxes when using an eVIP out of LHR? With LHR-MIA-ORD-LAX-MIA-JFK-LHR, there are 3 segments each way, but when you have more than 3 segments, can you pick which ones you want to apply the eVIP to?
Just book FRA-ATL-FRA-LHR and throw-away the last segment $803 a/i using the dates in my OP.
BTW, why don't you just credit your miles to AS Mileage Plan as they get all the miles that Asiamiles get too. Asiamiles' awards are not that great these days..

Any other dates, anybody? Having trouble finding the same deal ex-WAS.  Thanks!
.05$ pm = While very good, this is 5 cpm 150$ / 3000 miles = 15,000 c / 3,000 miles = 5 c / RDM or MQM.
Nice fare - it's a $108 baseno K-class NW availability for the dates I was looking at unfortunately!
Found this on FC. It is giving today's date, and it does appear as if same-day return is possible. Not sure what other dates it works for. Works out to about .05 cpm, which, out of DEN, is not too shabby. Hope this helps somebody!</value>
